很高兴认识你们所有人，我的名字叫特拉维斯·卡兰尼克，优步的联合创始人之一。

Let\'s see so I do a lot of speaking because we are we\'re a technology company that is we\'re in the trenches we\'re in the cities you know more than half of our employees are not in San Francisco.

让我们看看，所以我做了很多演讲，因为我们是一家科技公司，也就是说，我们在战壕里，我们在城市里，你知道，我们一半以上的员工不是在旧金山。

And I almost I don\'t even remember the last time I spoke in San Francisco in front of an audience.

我甚至都不记得上一次在旧金山当着观众的面发言是什么时候了。

Every time I go to speak somewhere I look I go on Google and I look at the roads I look at architecture I look at cool pictures I input that are iconic.

每次我去某个地方演讲，我就去谷歌，看看道路，看看建筑，看看我输入的很酷的图片，这些都是标志性的。

I\'m going to speak in Silicon Valley.

我要在硅谷发言。

I\'m searching google images and I can\'t find anything.

我正在搜索谷歌图片，却什么也找不到。

And so yeah there you go.

所以是的，给你。

It\'s good to be here

能在这里笑真好。

And it was I found a little something.

我发现了点东西。

所以，我猜这里的大多数人至少知道优步是什么。

But for those of you who don\'t I\'m going to go do sort of a basic tour just really quick.

但是对于那些不想去的人来说，我要去做一次基本的旅行，非常快。

It\'s an app on your iPhone that helps you get a car.

这是你iPhone上的一个应用程序，可以帮你买到一辆车。

Our motto is everyone\'s private driver

我们的座右铭是每个人的私人司机

and so you open up the app and you see a bunch of cars that are near you.

所以你打开这个应用程序,你会看到一堆车就在你身边。


This is one of the San Francisco cars three minutes away.

这是旧金山三分钟车程中的一辆。

and Jim will will arrive in two minutes.

吉姆两分钟后到。


He\'s rated a four point eight.

他被评为四点八。

And this is of course all screen shots from your app.

当然，这是你应用程序的所有屏幕截图。

When he arrives you\'re told you\'re notified in call the driver of course and if you\'re lucky he\'ll open the door for you when you\'re done.

当他来的时候，你会被告知你会接到通知，当然，如果你幸运的话，他会在你完成任务后帮你开门。

This is a short trip.

这是一次短途旅行。

Fifteen dollars that\'s our minimum in San Francisco.

我们在旧金山的最低限额是十五美元。

Of course we have lower cost options.

当然，我们有较低的成本选择。

Now we have something called Uber axe a couple days ago we launched taxi in San Francisco for a lot of folks are like you\'re doing taxes here the anti taxi what are you doing.

几天前，我们在旧金山推出了一款名为优步(Uber)的出租车，因为很多人都喜欢你在这里征税，反出租车，你在做什么呢？

We know what we\'re doing.

我们知道我们在做什么。

But laughter we\'ll get to that in just a second.

但是笑声，我们马上就能讲到这一点。

All right.

好的

So some basics launched in June 2010.

因此，2010年6月推出了一些基础设施。

So we\'re we\'re just over two years old.

所以我们才两岁多。

We don\'t own cars we don\'t employ drivers.

我们没有汽车，我们不雇用司机。

A lot of people don\'t know that about us.

很多人不知道我们的事。

They think we we have all these assets.

他们认为我们拥有所有这些资产。

They think that we employ lots of cars we don\'t have 120 employees most of which are not in San Francisco.

他们认为我们雇佣了大量的汽车，我们没有120名员工，其中大部分不在旧金山。

We don\'t have a marketing spend.

我们没有营销支出。

We\'re deployed in 17 cities for some reason they\'re 16 here.

我们被部署在17个城市，原因是他们在这里只有16个。

We actually just softe launched in Sydney a couple days ago actually yesterday.

实际上，几天前我们刚刚在悉尼发布，实际上是昨天。

Amsterdam is coming very very shortly.

阿姆斯特丹很快就要来了。

And I think Minneapolis\'s and on here we did that a couple weeks ago.

我想明尼阿波利斯是的，我们几周前就这么做了。

So quick numbers hundreds of thousands of hours driven per week.

每周开车数十万小时。

Very interesting engagement figure 50 percent of figure 50% of all the people who have ever ridden on uber have ridden in the last 30 days

非常有趣的参与图50%的人在过去30天里骑过自行车


And remember when you ride your pain.

记住当你骑着你的痛苦。

So think about commerce.

所以想想商业吧。

About e-commerce site or our ecommerce app or 50 percent of the people who\'ve ever paid paid in the last 30 days.

关于电子商务网站或我们的电子商务应用程序，或者是在过去30天中付费的50%的人。

Average person is paying about 105 dollars a month in San Francisco is a bit higher than that.

旧金山的平均月薪是105美元，比这略高一点。

Prices are probably a bit too high.

价格可能有点太高了。

I know some of you felt that sting.

我知道你们中的一些人感到刺痛。

We\'re doing 26 percent month over month growth.

我们的月增长率为26%。

That\'s an average over the last now 16 17 months.

这是过去16个17个月的平均水平。

You go OK.

你可以走了。

Well if you start really low then you can grow really big but we\'re pretty big.

好吧，如果你开始的时候很低，那么你可以长得很大，但是我们很大。

Twelve months ago and if you do 26 percent month over month growth that means in 12 months you\'re 16 times bigger than you were four months ago.

12个月前，如果你按月增长26%，这意味着在12个月内，你比4个月前要大16倍。

So we\'re growing fast and in fact September over August was 29 percent month over month.

因此，我们的增长速度非常快，事实上，9月份比8月份增长了29%。

So I want to tell a little bit about our background and then hopefully if I have enough time get into some of the regulatory stuff which I know none of you guys want to hear about.

所以我想告诉大家一些关于我们的背景，然后希望如果我有足够的时间，进入一些监管的东西，我知道，你们谁都不想听到。

All right.

好的

So this you can\'t see really well because of all the lights but it\'s a romantic shot from the Eiffel Tower between with me and my co-founder Gary camp some you guys may Noam Hughesy founder stumble upon.

所以，你不能很好地看到，因为所有的灯光，但这是一个浪漫的拍摄之间的埃菲尔铁塔与我和我的共同创始人加里营地，有些人，可能是诺姆休斯创始人偶然发现。

It was in Paris at Le Web where we came up with this idea essentially you know he said look I just want to push a button and get a ride.

这是在巴黎勒维网，我们提出了这个想法，基本上，你知道，他说，看，我只是想按一个按钮，然后搭上车。

You know let\'s and let\'s make it a classy ride.

你知道，让我们让它成为一个优雅的旅程。

And that\'s kind of how we started.

我们就是这样开始的。

Paris in many ways is a sister city of San Francisco.

巴黎在很多方面都是旧金山的姐妹城市。

Impossible to get a cab there.

不可能在那里打车。

So this is something from the past.

所以这是过去的事。

This is what we call Halee.

这就是我们所说的海莉。

I\'m not sure if you guys have ever done that but some people actually put their arm out to get a cab.

我不确定你们是否曾经这样做过，但有些人实际上是为了打车而伸出手来的。

I don\'t I don\'t know what\'s going on.

我不知道发生了什么事。

It\'s a weird thing but this is what we used to see in San Francisco.

这是一件很奇怪的事，但这是我们过去在旧金山看到的。

I went through that when we first started actually it wasn\'t about taking over the world it wasn\'t about taking on corruption in every city around the world.

我经历过，当我们第一次开始的时候，实际上不是要接管世界，而不是在世界各地的每一个城市都要面对腐败。

It was actually just about being baller in San Francisco.

实际上是为了成为旧金山的一名球员。

And the only way to do it.

也是唯一的办法。

The original idea was let\'s go buy 10 EST classes.

最初的想法是让我们去买10个EST课程。

 \[00:05:10\] Let\'s hire 20 drivers and let\'s get a parking garage.

[00：05：10]让我们雇20名司机，让我们拥有一个停车场。

And I\'m like Garrett we\'re not buying any car Stu and we\'re not signing any lease on a parking garage.

我就像加勒特，我们不买任何汽车，斯图，我们也不签任何停车场的租约。

But the idea of pushing a button and getting a ride in within minutes was a magical one.

但是，在几分钟内按下按钮并搭上车的想法是一个神奇的想法。

And at the beginning it was a lifestyle thing.

一开始这是一种生活方式。

It was as classes for us and our hundred friends.

这是给我们和我们上百个朋友上课的。

And so that\'s where it started.

这就是开始的地方。

In order to use the app anybody could download it but in order to use it you had to have a special code that I gave you.

为了使用这个应用程序，任何人都可以下载它，但为了使用它，你必须有一个特殊的代码，我给你。

And pretty soon the inbox was just getting full of people who wanted the code because our friends were telling their friends and then you know I searched on Google images is my favorite thing.

很快，收件箱里就挤满了想要代码的人，因为我们的朋友告诉他们的朋友，然后你知道我搜索谷歌图片是我最喜欢的事情。

 \[00:05:50\] Explosive viral growth on the Internet.

[00：05：50]互联网上的病毒爆炸性增长。

And there you go.

然后就到了。

That was the best one I could find.

这是我能找到的最好的了。

We have this thing called God view.

我们有一种叫神观的东西。

This is an older version of God.

这是旧版的上帝。

You can see much more what\'s going on today but I can\'t show you the new version of God.

你可以看到更多今天发生的事情，但我不能给你看新版本的上帝。

It\'s too intense.

太紧张了。

But this is a screenshot of a Friday night.

但这是周五晚上的截图。

Very soon after we launch maybe a few weeks or something like that we had four trips going on at the same time we were going nuts.

不久后，我们推出，也许几个星期或类似的，我们有四次旅行，在同一时间，我们是疯了。

For trips like we got trips going on we got to dispatch the green line at the top there.

对于像我们正在进行的旅行一样，我们必须派遣在顶部的绿线在那里。

That\'s a dispatch.

那是一次调度。

He shouldn\'t have his arm up but he does but he\'s got to he\'s got a little briefcase which is cool.

他不应该举起手臂，但他必须这样做-他有一个很酷的小公文包。

That\'s Friday night early on in.

那是星期五晚上。

Now this is 5:00a.m.

现在是早上5点。

on a Monday.

在星期一。

 \[00:06:45\] The eyeballs by the way you see some eyeballs.

[00：06：45]你看到一些眼球的方式。

Every once in a while in there that\'s somebody opening an app.

每隔一段时间，就会有人在里面打开一个应用程序。

So we see when people open apps that helps us in demand prediction.

所以当人们打开应用程序来帮助我们预测需求时，我们会看到。

Remember we\'re a logistics company or what I\'d call it.

记住，我们是一家物流公司，或者我会怎么称呼它。

We were building an urban logistics fabric.

我们在建设一个城市物流体系。

So when you do something successful.

所以当你成功的时候。

Not everybody\'s happy.

不是每个人都快乐。

And the older the industry you are tackling the the more protected it is by government or by corruption or by both the more they\'re going to be upset about what you do.

而且，你所处理的行业越老，它就越受到政府、腐败或两者的保护，他们对你所做的事情就会感到更加不安。

We\'re making drivers lives a hell of a lot better they\'re making a lot more money they\'re making ends meet they\'re living their American dream.

我们让司机生活得更好，他们赚了更多的钱，他们的收入达到了他们的美梦。

And Uber is helping them do that.

优步正在帮助他们做到这一点。

Riders are getting around town much more efficiently I\'m not sure who hurts from this other than a particular incumbent industry which I would mention.

骑手们在城里走来走去的效率要高得多，我不知道除了我要提到的一个特定的现有行业之外，谁会因此受到伤害。

 \[00:07:39\] So a few metrics look when I\'m having a bad day I just go to our overall revenue graph laughter.

[00：07：39]所以当我有一个糟糕的一天的时候，我只看我们的总收入图表笑声。

 \[00:07:55\] This is a cool trick in Photoshop if you take that image and you flip it.

[00：07：55]这是Photoshop中的一个很酷的技巧，如果你拍下这张照片，然后翻转它。

It\'s like a smile.

就像一个微笑。

OK.

好的

All right.

好的

That\'s just gratuitous.

那是没有报酬的。

OK.

好的

Look we launched in Sanford.

听着我们在桑福德启动了。

Oh by the way.

顺便问一下。

So this.

所以这个。

This is what.

这就是什么。

26 percent month over month growth looks like and many times when I show this when I when I do presentations in cities every time we launch in a city we do this big launch event sort of have some high rollers and people who really make the city move.

月增长率是26%，很多时候，当我在城市里做演讲的时候，每次我们在一个城市里做一个大发布会，我们都会有一些高压路客和一些真正推动城市发展的人。

We sort of pay our respects to that city and and do a really nice dinner.

我们对那座城市表示敬意，并做了一顿非常好的晚餐。

And these folks are always leaning to the left looking for the Axis.

这些人总是倾向于左倾寻找轴心。

When we first launched first a lot of people go wow it\'s successful it\'s so obvious I call it the the hand to the palm to foresaid moment when they learn about Uber they\'re like I had this idea or I should have had this idea.

当我们第一次推出优步的时候，很多人都很成功，这很明显，我称之为“掌上明珠”，可以预见到当他们了解优步的时候，他们就像我有了这个想法，或者我应该有这样的想法。

When we first launched guys it wasn\'t easy getting our angel around.

当我们第一次发射的时候，让我们的天使四处走动并不容易。

People thought we were crazy limos in San Francisco.

人们认为我们是旧金山的疯狂豪华轿车。

But it took off like I said.

但它像我说的那样起飞了。

And so one of the interesting things before we went to our series they are sorry this is actually before our series be here which we did in November of last year.

所以，在我们开始我们的系列之前，有一件有趣的事情，他们很抱歉，这实际上是在我们的系列之前，我们在去年11月做的。

Was is this a one hit wonder or not is this only going to work in San Cisco because it\'s so screwed up.

这是不是一个热门奇迹，这是不是只会在圣西斯科工作，因为它是如此糟糕。

And so we start launching in other cities and this is a revenue chart on a weekly it\'s a weekly window which you could think of as like almost a moving average blue is San Francisco yellow is New York.

因此，我们开始在其他城市推出，这是一份每周收入图表，这是一个每周的窗口，你可以认为这几乎是一个移动平均线，蓝色是旧金山，黄色是纽约。

 \[00:09:34\] This is early on the brown is Seattle and the green there Chicago obviously we\'re way past that.

[00：09：34]这是早在布朗是西雅图和绿色的芝加哥，显然我们已经超过了这一点。

Now this is like sort of the first 100 days.

这就像是头100天。

But what we found is that every city we were rolling out would just say hey we didn\'t know it was going to work.

但我们发现，我们推出的每一个城市都会说：“嘿，我们不知道它会起作用。”

Every city we were rolling out got progressively better.

我们推出的每一个城市都逐渐变得更好。

Our operation side of the house got very efficient and then the technology and the number of people who knew about when we go in we went in to New York.

我们的操作方面变得非常有效率，然后技术和人数，谁知道，当我们进去，我们进入纽约。

We had a thousand people with credit cards on file without a car on the ground.

我们有一千人在没有车在地上的情况下持有信用卡。

 \[00:10:06\] So this wasn\'t a one hit wonder and so we just started launching a ton of cities and we have this double rainbow of metrics.

[00：10：06]所以这不是一个热门奇迹，所以我们刚刚开始推出大量的城市，我们有这双彩虹的度量标准。

What does it mean.

这是什么意思。

Remember as liquidity goes up this is you know people in the market place who are building a marketplace know what liquidity means that means demand and supply go up together if they don\'t have a marketplace.

记住，随着流动性的增加，你知道在市场上建立市场的人知道流动性意味着什么，这意味着如果他们没有市场的话，需求和供应就会同时上升。

In our world as liquidity goes up the quality of the experience goes up and it dramatically.

在我们的世界里，随着流动性的增加，体验的质量也会提高，而且会显着地提高。

Right.

正确的

So our average pickup times in San Francisco two minutes and 45 seconds when we first started in New York we\'re like 12 minute average pickup times and let me tell you you don\'t want to be delivering 12 minute pickup times to New Yorkers.

所以我们在旧金山的平均拾取时间是2分45秒，当我们刚开始在纽约的时候，我们的平均拾取时间大约是12分钟，让我告诉你们，你们不想给纽约人提供12分钟的接送时间。

They will kick your ass.

他们会踢你屁股的。

Laughter.

笑声。

So as it gets better now we\'re right around five minutes in New York and that\'s kind of when they lose their minds.

所以，随着情况好转，我们就在纽约待5分钟左右，这时他们就会失去理智。

As more people use it you go from the core user base to bigger.

随着越来越多的人使用它，你将从核心用户群转向更大的用户群。

The engagement actually gets deeper the number of rides per rider per month actually go up as we expand as a cool cohort graph.

每个骑手每月的乘车次数实际上会随着我们作为一个酷的队列图的扩展而增加。

But who cares.

但谁在乎呢。

The bottom line is that 50 percent of the people who ever use still use and we\'ve seen that from the beginning.

底线是，50%的使用者仍在使用，我们从一开始就看到了这一点。

This is an interesting one.

这是一个有趣的故事。

This is San Francisco indexed revenue.

这是旧金山的指数化收入。

So we\'re gettin there\'s lots of town cars in San Francisco right.

所以我们在旧金山有很多城里的车，对吗？

The number of town cars that there were in San Francisco before we got there was 600.

在我们到达旧金山之前，城里有600辆车。

There are now more cars dedicated to Uber than there were town cars in San Francisco when we got there.

现在专门为优步服务的汽车比我们到达旧金山时的城镇车还多。

And so you\'re like well this thing\'s going to slow down this train is going to slow down at some point.

所以你会觉得这东西会慢下来，火车在某个时候会慢下来。

We indexed San Francisco revenue from last year due July 1st through the end of the year and looked at this year July 1st to where we are now and it\'s tracking almost identical.

我们索引旧金山的收入从去年的7月1日至年底，并在今年7月1日，我们现在的情况，它的跟踪几乎相同。

So it\'s not slowing down any time soon and when you\'re talking about for a particular city 20 percent month over month growth that\'s that\'s really big growth especially when you\'re when the numbers are getting big.

因此，它不会在短期内放缓，当你谈论一个特定城市的月增长率为20%时，这将是一个非常大的增长，尤其是当这个数字越来越大的时候。

So on the operations side I think a lot of us are techies.

所以在行动方面，我认为我们很多人都是技术人员。

You know I\'m an engineer by training.

你知道我是个受过训练的工程师。

We know what product managers are we know what that means but when you\'re on the ground when your technology touches people and it touches cities what you have to do is have process managers process managers or similar product managers they manage the process that people do versus machines and the roadmap for product has to dovetail with the roadmap for process because any time we change anything that happens in a car that\'s got to change the tack and vice versa.

我们知道什么是产品经理，我们知道这意味着什么，但是当你在地面上，当你的技术接触到人们，它涉及到城市时，你必须做的是让过程经理或类似的产品经理来管理人们所做的过程，而机器和产品的路线图必须与过程路线图相吻合，因为任何时候我们都要改变任何事情发生在必须改变策略的汽车上，反之亦然。

So it\'s really interesting mapping processes that we go through.

所以我们所经历的映射过程非常有趣。

 \[00:12:56\] Come on.

[00：12：56]来吧。

 \[00:12:58\] This is supposed to be a picture of Europe.

[00：12：58]这是一张欧洲的照片。

We\'re rolling out very big in Europe right now so getting the operational expertise.

我们现在欧洲推出了非常大的业务专长。

I think this just isn\'t talked a lot about in startups is the operations side of the business.

我认为这只是\在初创企业中谈论得不多，而是业务的运营方面。

I think a lot of e-commerce companies see that we see it on a very deep level because you know the rubber\'s actually meeting the road but getting teams ready to roll out in Europe is something we\'ve been spending time in Paris and London right now.

我认为很多电子商务公司都看到了我们在一个非常深的层面上看到了这一点，因为你知道橡胶实际上是在满足道路，但让团队准备在欧洲推出是我们现在花在巴黎和伦敦的时间。

Like I said we\'re gonna be in Amsterdam very soon and there\'s a whole host of other cities that were that are lined up in Europe and that\'s going to be a big push.

就像我说的，我们很快就会来到阿姆斯特丹，还有很多其他城市在欧洲排成一排，这将是一个巨大的推动。

And this year also in the first half of next year we have somebody in Asia ready to go and city sort of our first city in Asia Pac and I can\'t wait to go to a launch party.

今年，也是在明年上半年，我们有亚洲的一些人准备去，我们在亚洲的第一个城市-太平洋航空公司，我迫不及待地要去参加一个发射派对。

OK.

好的

So quality and choice.

所以质量和选择。

It was really interesting right.

真的很有趣对吧。

We had this high end thing it\'s costs about 50 percent more than a cab.

我们有一种高端的东西，它的成本比一辆出租车高出50%。

And everybody said oh there\'s high end and everybody goes wow I\'m going to do a low cost Uber.

每个人都说，哦，有高端，每个人都会说，哇，我要做一个低成本的优步。

There\'s like a few companies out there I can remember their names that decide they\'re going to be a low cost to run they clone our app.

就像有几家公司，我记得他们的名字，决定他们将是一个低成本运行，他们克隆我们的应用。

You know they flatter us by basically stealing all the pixels and copying them over to their app.

你知道，他们通过窃取所有像素并将它们复制到他们的应用程序来讨好我们。

Uber Edwy Uber is going to be a low cost Uber but it\'s about quality and choice and what we see when we low when we roll out a low cost option.

Uber Edwy Uber将是一个低成本的优步，但它是关于质量和选择，以及当我们推出低成本选择时我们看到了什么。

What we see is that actually engagement gets deeper because people have choice they don\'t have to always get the expensive thing so they start using it more often people who maybe wouldn\'t start with the black car products start with taxi or what we call Uber X and then it\'s date night and they will improve.

我们看到的是，事实上，订婚越来越深，因为人们有选择，他们不必总是得到昂贵的东西，所以他们开始更频繁地使用它，他们可能不会从黑色汽车产品开始，从出租车开始，或者我们称之为优步X，然后它的约会之夜，他们会改进。

You know they want to impress their lady or they just need a comfortable ride.

你知道他们想给自己的女士留下深刻印象，或者他们只是需要一辆舒适的车。

And it goes from there.

从那里开始。

So this was a choice a beautiful thing let\'s keep moving taxi we did in Chicago in April.

所以，这是一个很好的选择，让我们继续开出租车吧，我们四月在芝加哥做的。

We now have a few cities were in Boston Toronto Chicago San Francisco we were in New York BOPA.

我们现在有几个城市在波士顿，多伦多，芝加哥，旧金山，我们在纽约，波帕。

 \[00:15:08\] Not anymore.

[00：15：08]不再是了。

Don\'t get me started.

别让我开始。

Fair enough we\'ll get to that at the end.

公平地说，我们会在最后做到这一点的。

We did Uber acts which is sort of like a low end Uber where we did this in July in San Francisco in New York and that\'s where it\'s basically 30 percent cheaper.

我们做了Uber的表演，这有点像低端的Uber，我们7月份在纽约的旧金山做了这件事，那里的价格基本上便宜了30%。

All hybrid fleet at least inS.F.

所有混合动力舰队，至少在安全部队。

where we\'re starting to diversify a little bit out of hybrids because we can\'t get the partners to buy cars fast enough.

在这里，我们开始从混合动力车转向多样化，因为我们无法让合作伙伴足够快地购买汽车。

But the thing is as you push a button and a car appears in five minutes and feels magical but how you make that happen is actually very complex.

但事情是，当你按下一个按钮，一辆车出现在五分钟内，感觉很神奇，但你如何使它发生实际上是非常复杂的。

So we have a math department here.

我们这里有个数学系。

I like to tell them I say look guys you\'re in charge of our margins right because they need to get the pickup times really low but the utilization really high.

我想告诉他们，听着，伙计们，你们负责我们的利润，因为他们需要的收货时间很低，但利用率却很高。

How do you do that right.

你怎么做对的。

Well you do that through a lot of math.

你用了很多数学才能做到这一点。

Let\'s start with our math department.

我们从数学系开始吧。

Okay that\'s not my math department.

好吧那不是我的数学系。

We have two nuclear physicists on staff.

我们有两名核物理学家。

Computational neuroscientist a machine learning expert and a few other guys there.

计算机神经学家，机器学习专家和其他一些人。

They\'re killing it and some of the things they do.

他们正在扼杀它和他们所做的一些事情。

They do demand prediction congestion prediction supply matching supply positioning smart dispatch algorithms dynamic pricing Friday and Saturday night or special nights.

他们做需求预测，拥挤预测，供应匹配，供应定位，智能调度算法，动态定价，星期五和星期六晚上或特殊的夜晚。

We sometimes get really big waves of demand that you can\'t really get enough cars to do anything about.

我们有时会遇到一波又一波的需求，你无法得到足够的汽车来做任何事情。

So you have a marketplace oriented sort of dynamic pricing element that clears the market it gets more cars on the road and in sort of lassoes in sort of uncontrollable demand.

所以你有一个以市场为导向的动态定价元素，它可以清除市场，让更多的汽车在路上行驶，在某种程度上是不可控制的需求。

You can\'t see these pictures really well because of the lights but they\'re pretty these are some heat maps of cities.

你不能很好地看到这些照片，因为灯光，但它们很漂亮，这是一些城市的热图。

This isD.C.

这是华盛顿。

right here.

就在这儿。

But you guys probably can\'t see it.

但你们可能看不见。

This is Manhattan.

这里是曼哈顿。

Can\'t you tell.

你看不出来吗。

Anyways these are useless.

不管怎样，这些都是没用的。

I\'ll just keep going.

我还是继续走吧。

Okay.

好的。

All right.

好的

This right here is what drivers see.

这就是司机们看到的。

This is our supply positioning so in our company when mass goes operational that becomes how am I doing on time by the way.

这是我们的供应定位，所以在我们公司，当大众开始运作时，顺便说一句，我是如何准时完成的。

I have no timing here.

我没有时间。

Eight minutes left.

还有八分钟。

All right.

好的

Minutes left.

只剩几分钟了。

All right.

好的

This is going to suck.

这会很糟糕的。

All right.

好的

All right.

好的

So supply positioning right we have a heat map of demand but we basically were predicting demand 20 minutes ahead of time.

因此，供应定位正确，我们有一个需求热图，但我们基本上是提前20分钟预测需求。

The problem is is that if I gave the heat map to drivers they\'ll all go to the same spot and then they\'ll be bad for a lot of people who aren\'t in that hot spot.

问题是，如果我把热图给司机，他们都会去同一个地方，对很多不在那个热点的人来说是不好的。

So what we do is we say here\'s the heatmap of demand or prediction for 20 minutes time.

但对于一名司机来说，他可能早上有几个小时的时间，晚上或下午有一两个小时的时间，用源源不断的收入来填满时间，可以帮助他维持收支平衡。
