**Ron Conway at Startup School 2012-1z87RGFGuxQ.mp4**  


\[00:00:00\] The funny thing is we\'re we\'re sitting in the back seeing which switch stories can we tell in which ones are too secret because for every wrong who is like an iceberg for every story.

[00：00]有趣的是，我们坐在后面，看哪些故事太秘密了，因为对于每一个错误，谁就像每一个故事的冰山。

Where were you where you hear how he saved the day.

你在哪里听说他救了我。

There\'s a bunch where you can never tell how he saved the day he was ever seen Pulp Fiction sort of like the Wolf.

有一群人，你永远不知道他是如何拯救了他曾经被看到的纸浆小说，有点像“狼”。

He\'s clean cleaned a lot of brains off the back wins windows and cars.

他干干净净地洗了很多后脑勺，赢得了窗户和汽车。

 \[00:00:27\] He laughs nervously but does not contradict me.

[00：00：27]他紧张地笑着，但没有反驳我。

So Ron and Ron like officially Ron is ASV angel right.

所以罗恩和罗恩就像正式的罗恩一样，是ASV天使对吧。

 \[00:00:38\] You are the limited partners.

[00：00：38]你们是有限合伙人。

Something like that of SB angel.

就像某人的天使。

 \[00:00:41\] I\'m not a managing partner.

[00：00：41]我不是管理合伙人。

David Leighs the managing partner because I don\'t like being a fiduciary.

大卫·雷伊是执行合伙人，因为我不喜欢做信托人。

I am just the largest investor.

我只是最大的投资者。

 \[00:00:50\] But officially Ron Conway doesn\'t invest in your company worthS.V.

[00：00：50]但根据官方说法，罗恩·康维并不投资于你的公司。

angel investor right.

天使投资者是对的。

So if you ever see that in a cap table that\'s that\'s Ranko.

所以，如果你在帽子桌上看到这个，那就是兰科。

 \[00:00:59\] So how many startups have you funded now since 1994.

[00：00：59]自1994年以来，你资助了多少家初创公司？

About six hundred and fifty 1994.

大约六百五十个1994年。

 \[00:01:08\] How many and we\'re not born yet in 1994.

[00：01：08]1994年有多少人还没有出生。

It\'s not that many 650 including Can you name some of the more successful ones.

它没有那么多650，你能说出其中一些比较成功的吗？

 \[00:01:21\] Ask Jeeves was the first.

[00：01：21]问吉夫斯是第一个。

A good quality event that we had Google Facebook Twitter page how Pinterest.

一个高质量的事件，我们有谷歌Facebook Twitter页面如何Pinterest。

 \[00:01:30\] OK.

[00：01：30]好的。

You\'re doing pretty well.

你做得很好。

 \[00:01:33\] And then and then the see companies air BMV and Dropbox.

[00：01：33]然后看公司的航空BMV和Dropbox。

The way I see companies that are already getting very big scale.

在我看来，已经有了很大规模的公司。

 \[00:01:43\] How did you how did you get into this.

[00：01：43]你是怎么弄到这件事的。

You started out as a founder yourself right back when startups made computers.

当创业公司制造电脑的时候，你开始是一个创立者。

Right.

右（边），正确的

 \[00:01:52\] Even though I don\'t invest in hardware today the company that I cofounded was Alto\'s computer back in the late 70s and we ended up taking their company public in 1982 and and my experience at Alto\'s plus two other startups that I cofounded is what gives me such respect for what entrepreneurs go through.

[00：01：52]尽管我今天不投资硬件，但我共同创立的公司是20世纪70年代末的Alto电脑，我们最终在1982年将他们的公司上市，而我在阿尔托公司(Alto‘s)的经历，再加上我共同创立的另外两家初创公司，让我对企业家的经历产生了如此的尊重。

The theme all day is that hey it\'s not easy it\'s it\'s actually hard.

整天的主题是，嘿，这不容易，实际上很难。

I know that because I did it it was even harder then in a lot of ways.

我知道，因为我做到了，在很多方面甚至更难。

You\'re raising money stories.

你在筹钱。

Yes.

是

Back in 0 back in the late 70s in order to get venture capital you had to have high growth and be profitable if you weren\'t you didn\'t even qualify.

回到70年代末的0，为了获得风险投资，你必须有高增长，如果你没有资格的话，你就能盈利。

 \[00:02:48\] So why did people take venture capital profitable and growing fast.

[00：02：48]那么，为什么人们会拿风险投资赚钱，而且增长很快。

Well in the case of Alto it was a hardware company.

就阿尔托而言，那是一家硬件公司。

 \[00:02:56\] So we had a lot of cost of goods and marketing.

[00：02：56]所以我们的商品和营销成本很高。

And so we wanted to build a war chest to keep building the business.

所以我们想要建立一个战争基金来继续建立业务。

 \[00:03:06\] Okay.

[00：03：06]好的。

 \[00:03:07\] So that in fact Da Vinci was Don Valentine from Sequoia who you know is really I think the patron saint of venture capital patron.

[00：03：07]事实上，达·芬奇是红杉的唐·瓦伦丁，你知道吗，我认为他是风投赞助人的守护神。

 \[00:03:18\] He\'s retired now.

[00：03：18]他现在退休了。

What was.

是什么。

What\'s changed about startups since then.

从那以后，初创公司发生了什么变化。

 \[00:03:27\] Well I I think it\'s I\'d rather talk about what\'s not changed.

[00：03：27]嗯，我想我宁愿说什么没有改变。

 \[00:03:33\] OK sure.

[00：03：33]好的。

That was going to be my next question.

这将是我的下一个问题。

Oh yes.

哦，是的。

 \[00:03:37\] Because what\'s not changed is what Jessica talked about which is you have to have determination and conviction.

[00：03：37]因为杰西卡所说的没有改变，那就是你必须有决心和信念。

You have to be a leader.

你必须是一个领导者。

You know what has changed is in the workplace people drink less at Alto\'s.

你知道，改变的是在工作场所，人们在阿尔托喝得更少。

 \[00:04:01\] That\'s not what I thought you were going to buy in the back of my mind.

[00：04：01]那不是我以为你会在我脑子里买的东西。

 \[00:04:03\] I\'ve been saying hey wait a minute I want to answer the question about what has changed at Alto\'s.

‘

We had a CFO who is in her 60s and at five o\'clock everyday she would wheel around the booze cart everyone would have a drink chit chat for a little bit.

我们有一位60多岁的首席财务官，每天五点左右，她会在酒车里转来转去，每个人都会喝一杯，聊一聊。

It wasn\'t even a happy hour.

那不是一个快乐的时刻。

It was a happy 10 minutes.

这是一个快乐的10分钟。

But then it motivated everyone to stay till 9 or 10 o\'clock at night.

但它激励着每个人在晚上9点或10点之前。

Now our Modou are kind of a model was work hard and play hard.

现在，我们的MOMOU是一种模式，是努力工作和娱乐的。

 \[00:04:38\] And at the same time Yeah we actually we did it via multitasking I think the startup\'s today know how to segment a little better and they have happy hour at the on a Friday instead of everyday instead of everyday.

[00：04：38]同时，是的，我们实际上是通过多任务完成的，我认为今天的初创公司知道如何更好地分割，他们在星期五而不是每天都有快乐的时间。

So what else is changing besides breaking.

所以除了破碎之外还有什么变化。

 \[00:05:00\] Well I think what has not changed is is the fact that once you you have to focus on growth.

[00：05：00]我认为没有改变的是，一旦你必须专注于增长。

Back in the hardware days you didn\'t have to focus.

在硬件时代，你不需要集中精力。

In my opinion on product or consumer satisfaction is much interesting.

在我看来，对产品或消费者的满意是非常有趣的。

Yeah it was more like you know Ship Ship Ship and get it out and if it doesn\'t work take it back and fix it because hardware was so hard to ship that if you could ship at all.

是的，它更像是你知道船，把它拿出来，如果它不能工作，把它拿回来修理它，因为硬件太难出货了，如果你能出货的话。

 \[00:05:31\] That was consumer satisfaction.

[00：05：31]那是消费者的满意。

Exactly.

一点儿没错

Customers were happy just to get it back at the end of it if it didn\'t work.

如果它不起作用的话，顾客们很乐意在它结束的时候把它拿回来。

 \[00:05:38\] We had this big RMV department return material authorizations.

[00：05：38]我们有一个很大的RMV部门退回材料授权书。

But today what\'s changed.

但今天一切都变了。

And now whileS.V.

而现在.。

ángela the best decision I ever made in 1994 was only to invest in Internet software in 1994 in 1994 so I think hardware scarred me.

1994年我所做的最好的决定就是在1994年投资于互联网软件，所以我认为硬件给我留下了伤痕。

But but that was the best decision I ever made is that in 94 thinking this thing called the Internet is going to be really disruptive.

但这是我做过的最好的决定，在94年的时候，我认为这个叫做互联网的东西会带来很大的破坏。

 \[00:06:12\] Back then like 1984.

[00：06：12]那时就像1984年。

It probably meant the Internet not the web like the web sort of existed.

它可能意味着互联网，而不是像网络那样存在的网络。

 \[00:06:17\] Had you heard of it when you decided to go into Internet investing back in 1990 were you thinking like FPP in e-mail.

[00：06：17]当你在1990年决定投资互联网的时候，你听说过吗？你在电子邮件中想过像FPP那样的想法吗？

Well it would be it would be more like people would say TCP/IP.

这更像是人们所说的TCP/IP。


 \[00:06:30\] Yeah as often as they would say the Internet.

[00：06：30]是的，就像他们常说的互联网一样。

And I remember it as TCP/IP at the time but in the end people would talk about email but know they\'d have to explain what e-mail was.

我记得当时它是TCP/IP，但最终人们会谈论电子邮件，但他们知道他们必须解释电子邮件是什么。

 \[00:06:44\] It was this protocol on TCP/IP.

[00：06：44]这是TCP/IP上的协议。

 \[00:06:49\] So you sort of didn\'t get in at the ground floor of an idiot investor and you got it in a basement or in the basement go up say yes to the lowly went up the stairs to the to the first floor.

[00：06：49]所以你不是在一个白痴投资者的底层，而是在地下室或者地下室里，对低层的人说“是的”，然后爬到第一层。

How did you like that was a really good decision.

你觉得这是个很好的决定。

It turns out to get into Internet investing in 1994.

结果是在1994年进入互联网投资。

But like why did how did you do that.

但就像你为什么要这么做。

 \[00:07:08\] Well I was in CO investing with Ben Rosen at the time after founding a couple of companies I discovered because I started dabbling in angel investing that I really enjoyed mentoring entrepreneurs more than being the entrepreneur or myself.

[00：07：08]在我创立了几家公司后，我在CO投资公司工作，因为我开始涉足天使投资，我更喜欢指导企业家，而不是作为企业家或我自己。

So in 94 is when I sold my second company and went home and told my wife hey you know I found a new job and she said I didn\'t know you were looking.

所以，在94年，我卖掉了第二家公司，回家对妻子说嘿，你知道我找到了一份新工作，她说我不知道你在找什么。

And I said Yeah I\'m going to do this angel investing for the rest of my life.

我说，是的，我要做这个天使投资我的余生。

 \[00:07:44\] What did she think of that.

[00：07：44]她是怎么想的。

Did she know what she was getting into.

她知道她在做什么吗。

 \[00:07:47\] She\'s always thought it was crazy so she thinks I\'m crazy today.

[00：07：47]她总是认为这很疯狂，所以她认为我今天疯了。

But but.

但是.。

 \[00:07:56\] I sat with Ben Rosen who is then the chairman of Compaq.

[00：07：56]我和当时担任康柏公司主席的本·罗森坐在一起。

Ben lives in New York and we said.

本住在纽约我们说。

Innovation is all about growth.

创新就是增长。

So we said let\'s just find a sector that\'s growing like crazy or is going to grow like crazy and be disruptive because innovation is disruptive.

所以我们说，让我们找到一个正在疯狂成长的行业，或者是一个疯狂的行业，因为创新是颠覆性的。

And we said hey let\'s let\'s just throw all in on the internet so our only rural is Internet software and off we went in sitting here today still only Internet software.

我们说，嘿，让我们把一切都投入到互联网上吧，所以我们唯一的农村是互联网软件，今天我们坐在这里，仍然只有互联网软件。

Now the market\'s gotten huge.

现在市场变得很大。

I still think we\'re in the infancy on the internet though I\'ve been saying this since 1994 I believe it more than ever.

我仍然认为我们在互联网上还处于起步阶段，尽管我从1994年就开始这么说了，我比以往任何时候都更相信这一点。

Just add a little touch of e-commerce on top of the Internet and you\'re talking about you know an opportunity that\'s as big as all the Internet today especially with with Facebook an open graph helping companies go find their customers and Pinterest will probably be an effect fact I\'ll quote the monetization guy on twitter.

只要在互联网上加上一点电子商务，你就会知道一个机会和今天所有的互联网一样大，特别是在Facebook上，一个开放的图表帮助公司找到他们的客户，Pinterest可能会成为一个影响的事实，我会在Twitter上引用这个赚钱的家伙的话。

I won\'t even take the risk of misquoting but the monetization guy at Twitter told me a couple of weeks ago he goes a Twitter is on a tear.

我甚至不愿意冒错误引用的风险，但Twitter的货币化者几周前告诉我，他去推特(Twitter)是一滴眼泪。

Now you know like Google and Facebook once they get to stride you know Twitter\'s got a really nice growth rate now took awhile more than normal revenue growth revenue growth.

现在你知道了，就像谷歌和Facebook一样，一旦他们开始大步前进，你就知道Twitter的增长速度非常好，现在的增长速度要比正常的收入增长要花上一段时间。

Okay this is about revenue growth and this guy said to me it will never grow like Pinterest was once they decide to monetize because they will be an e-commerce engine like never before and they\'ll there\'ll be many other companies like that that take advantage of e-commerce.

好吧，这是关于收入增长的，这个人对我说，Pinterest公司永远不会像Pinterest那样，决定赚钱，因为他们将成为一个前所未有的电子商务引擎，他们还会有许多像这样的公司利用电子商务。

So it\'s it\'s early days.

所以现在还早呢。

 \[00:09:53\] That\'s encouraging.

[00：09：53]这是鼓舞人心的。

Yeah I couldn\'t be more and you agree with you agree with Ben Horowitz there\'s still stuff left here and lots of lots.

是的，我不能再多了，你同意本？霍洛维茨的观点，这里还有很多东西。

So what are the biggest.

那么最大的是什么。

What are the biggest misses you\'ve had.

你最大的失误是什么？

You remember some big ones you missed.

你还记得一些你错过的大案子。

 \[00:10:08\] Well yes.

[00：10：08]是的。

This is in 1998 99 when the bubble was starting to take effect and I thought 30 million dollar valuation forSalesforce.com was a little too high.

这是在1998年99年泡沫开始生效的时候，我认为Salesforce.com 3000万美元的估值有点太高了。

It\'s 21 billion today.

今天是210亿。

Pandora Pandora.

潘多拉。

I had just gotten out of Napster Napster fire and finally had to declare bankruptcy because of all the egos in the world and in the music world.

我刚刚从纳普斯特大火中解脱出来，最后因为世界上和音乐世界里所有的自我，我不得不宣布破产。

I don\'t think it\'s just egos in them.

我不认为这只是他们的自我。

I wish.

我希望。

And so I was I was hedging on the music space so for that reason I didn\'t invest in Pandora Palin Teer could have injured invested there didn\'t understand the size of the market even though we invest in the entrepreneur first.

因此，我在音乐领域进行对冲，因此我没有投资潘多拉·佩林·蒂尔(Pandora Palin Teer)，这可能会伤害我在那里的投资，他不了解市场的规模，尽管我们首先投资的是企业家。

In the case of Pandora you know I made a dumb move and said hey I\'m not sure I get how big that market is.

在潘多拉的例子中，你知道我做了一个愚蠢的举动，说：嘿，我不确定我是否知道这个市场有多大。

Kickstarter we could have invested in it in early as well didn\'t really get what.

Kickstarter，我们可以在早期投资它，但没有真正得到什么。

What crowdsourcing was.

众包是什么。

And look at that space today.

看看今天的空间。

It\'s it\'s the lifeblood for a lot of startups and we have the.

这是许多初创公司的命脉，我们有。

The jobs act that takes the legal confusion out of crowdsourcing.

就业法案从众包中消除了法律上的混乱。

 \[00:11:43\] Do you think.

[00：11：43]你认为。

Do you think there\'s a pattern to what investors miss.

你认为投资者所错过的东西是有规律的吗？

In general not just you but investors in general.

一般来说，不仅仅是你，还有一般的投资者。

If there\'s a founders are working on something that\'s good but investors are not going to get like what kind of things do investors not get.

如果有一位创始人正在做一件好事，但投资者不会得到投资者所没有的那种东西。

 \[00:11:59\] Well I think investors don\'t get probably the stuff that is you know is the first one.

[00：11：59]我认为投资者可能没有得到你知道的第一件事。

Pinterest would be an example.

Pinterest就是一个例子。

Ben talked about how hard it was to raise money.

本谈到筹集资金有多难。

And if you look at a virtual Pinboard you know that\'s a brand new idea.

如果你看一下虚拟棋盘，你就会知道这是一个全新的想法。

So I think investors even though they like to say I\'m in venture capital I take risk.

因此，我认为投资者，即使他们喜欢说我在风险投资，我承担风险。

They look for pattern recognition which in this business is probably a mistake.

他们寻找模式识别，这在这个行业可能是一个错误。

Look at Twitter in the early days you know that was that was a brand that was a brand new idea and lots of Easy\'s turned down Twitter.

看看早期的Twitter，你知道这是一个全新的想法，很多人都很容易拒绝Twitter。

 \[00:12:46\] So with SFE you\'ll tell the story of how you ended up investing in Twitter.

[00：12：46]有了SFE，你会讲述你是如何在Twitter上投资的。

Sure that\'s a funny story with a way it is with V Angel though we invest in in the entrepreneur first.

当然，这是一个有趣的故事，虽然我们首先投资的是企业家，但V天使也是如此。

 \[00:13:00\] We invest in the human being and all of our biggest successes is when we said hey wow that\'s a really forward thinking idea but let\'s go run with it.

[00：13：00]我们投资于人类，我们最大的成功是当我们说嗨，哇，这是一个非常前瞻的想法，但让我们继续努力吧。

I love that entrepreneur.

我喜欢那个企业家。

I want to invest in every one of their companies.

我想投资他们的每一家公司。

So so when I invest in an entrepreneur I\'m investing for life unless they do something wrong.

因此，当我投资于一位企业家时，我将终生投资，除非他们做错了什么。

I want to invest for example in Shawn Fanning\'s sixth startup airtime.

例如，我想投资于肖恩·范宁(ShawnFning)的第六个创业时间。

So for me it\'s it\'s a lifelong commitment.

所以对我来说，这是一种终生的承诺。

It makes it more interesting when you have this awesome relationship with a founder where they know me like a book and I know them like a book so we can move fast and give each other advice.

当你和一位创始人建立了一段令人敬畏的关系时，他们就像一本书一样了解我，而我就像一本书一样了解他们，这样我们就能快速行动，给对方建议。

So you invested in Odeo right.

所以你投资了Odeo对吧。

Yeah.

嗯

So back to Twitter.

回到推特。

Back to Twitter I invested in Odeo with Evan Williams and his team Jack Dorsey was part of that team.

回到Twitter，我与EvanWilliams和他的团队投资了Odeo，杰克·多尔西也是这个团队的一员。

So is Biz Stone and ODEIO didn\'t work out and Odeo was in an incubator called ObviousCorp.

BizStone和ODEIO也没有成功，Odeo也在一个名为ObviousCorp的孵化器里。

So it is a classical innovator incubator who had like four or five projects going on Twitter was one of those other projects.

所以，这是一个经典的创新者孵化器，在Twitter上有四五个项目，也是其他项目之一。

Jack was the father of the Twitter project and Odeo ended up shutting down.

杰克是Twitter项目的父亲，Odeo最终被关闭。

 \[00:14:21\] Evan Williams was magnanimous to the investors and gave the investors their money back.

埃文·威廉姆斯对投资者宽宏大量，把他们的钱还给了投资者。

Here\'s an entrepreneur.

这是一位企业家。

Felt so bad and he had made a little bit of money not a ton of money certainly not enough to give your money back.

他感到很难过，他赚了一点钱，没有一吨钱，当然也不足以把你的钱还给你。

He made a little bit of money selling Blogger to Google but he he felt an obligation to pay the investors back and I said this is going to sit in the bank until your next one and the next one was Twitter.

他把博客卖给谷歌，赚了点钱，但他觉得有义务回报投资者，我说过，这会一直呆在银行里，直到你的下一个博客，下一个是推特(Twitter)。

So I invested 75 K in Twitter site on scene zero due diligence because I believed in that entrepreneur and then I got to know Jack and and look at Twitter today.

所以我在Twitter网站上投入了75K，因为我相信这位企业家，然后我认识了杰克，今天看了Twitter。

 \[00:15:01\] So you just you were already signed up for Twitter.

[00：15：01]你刚刚注册了Twitter。

I was free where it was three three boarded on that airplane.

在那架飞机上有三个人登上的地方我是自由的。

That\'s what I called betting on foul with no with no questions asked.

这就是我所谓的下注犯规，不问任何问题。

What did you think of Twitter as an idea.

你认为Twitter是什么想法。

Guess what.

猜猜看

Never.

绝不可能

 \[00:15:20\] Never argue with the metrics.

[00：15：20]永远不要与度量标准争论。

So Twitter.

所以推特。

It wasn\'t long before Twitter\'s growth rate on users and numbers of tweets was straight up there just now revenues going to catch up with it.

不久之后，Twitter在用户上的增长速度和推特的数量都直线上升，而现在，Twitter的收入将迎头赶上。

It\'s going to be an awesome company but I never argue with growth so whenever we see a company that\'s growing at a thousand percent a month and in the early days when you\'re successful you will grow at a thousand percent a month because going from one users to 10 users.

这将是一家了不起的公司，但我从来不反对增长，所以每当我们看到一家公司以每月1000%的速度增长，在你成功的初期，你就会因为从一个用户增加到10个用户而每月增长百分之一。

But if if they\'re happy users and there\'s word of mouth because Twitter never advertise and there\'s good word of mouth and good PR that\'s the greatest company you can get.

但如果用户很满意，因为Twitter从来不做广告，而且有好的口碑和公关，那么这是你能得到的最好的公司。

Look at the growth of Google.

看看谷歌的发展。

Google was the very same way.

谷歌也是如此。

 \[00:16:10\] So Twitter you thought basically I don\'t know what this thing is.

[00：16：10]所以Twitter你认为基本上我不知道这是什么。

The graphs seem to be going about it.

这些图表似乎正在进行中。

But yeah but it\'s growing which means users like it which means it\'s going to be successful.

但是的，但是它正在增长，这意味着用户喜欢它，这意味着它将是成功的。

 \[00:16:19\] There must be something there because if you look at Google Facebook and Twitter none of them had any idea what the monetization outcome was going to be.

[00：16：19]一定有一些东西，因为如果你看看谷歌，Facebook和Twitter，他们都不知道货币化的结果会是什么。

All they focused on was happy users and getting lots of them quickly.

他们所关注的只是快乐的用户，很快就能得到很多用户。

And that ends up that\'s a great strategy.

最后那是个很好的策略。

That\'s what Ben Silverman is doing at Pinterest today.

这就是本？西尔弗曼今天在Pinterest所做的事情。

 \[00:16:40\] They just knew that there was an important problem to be solved and they sort of had faith they would be able to make money somehow of course.

[00：16：40]他们只是知道有一个重要的问题需要解决，他们有信心，他们当然能够赚钱。

 \[00:16:47\] And now Google is the one who probably took the biggest risk because now Ben can at least look back to Google Facebook and Twitter and say wow they made sure they had like a hundred million happy users and then they thought about monetization and you actually don\'t need to think about monetization that much.

[00：16：47]现在谷歌可能是冒最大风险的人，因为现在Ben至少可以回顾谷歌的Facebook和Twitter，并说哇，他们确保拥有大约一亿快乐的用户，然后他们考虑了货币化，而你实际上不需要考虑那么多货币化。

Once you get to 100 million users gives you time to figure out hey wait a minute you know there\'s there\'s ways to turn this into a really viable business.

一旦你有了1亿用户，你就有时间去弄清楚，嘿，等一下，你知道有办法把它变成一家真正可行的企业。

 \[00:17:16\] So  \[00:17:16\] when Larry and Sergei were starting out doing Google they really didn\'t have they didn\'t know how they were going to make money.

所以[00：17：16]拉里和谢尔盖刚开始做谷歌的时候，他们真的不知道该如何赚钱。

 \[00:17:23\] No not at all.

[00：17：23]不，一点也不。

I still have Google\'s first ten page investor slide deck and you get to the last page and it says thank you it doesn\'t.

我还有谷歌前十页的投资者幻灯片，你可以看到最后一页，上面写着“谢谢”-它没有。

 \[00:17:37\] It does not have the spreadsheet that is usually the last page.

[00：17：37]它没有通常是最后一页的电子表格。

 \[00:17:42\] Yeah.

[00：17：42]是的。

And they were not apologetic about it.

他们并没有为此道歉。

They said we have awesome technology and it will lead to monetization and we\'re not going to tell you something we don\'t know because we don\'t know how we\'re going to monetize it.

他们说我们有超棒的技术，它将导致货币化，我们不会告诉你一些我们不知道的事情，因为我们不知道我们将如何将它货币化。

They were very honest about it and that was a novel thing in those days that was very novel and that\'s why people misconstrued that as arrogance when in fact Larry and Serguei were just being really bluntly honest with the investors that came in to see them.

他们对此非常诚实，这在当时是一件很新奇的事，这也是为什么人们把它误解为傲慢，而实际上，拉里和塞尔盖只是对前来看他们的投资者非常坦率地诚实。

They were like hey if you look at our search results and they were so much better than the prior search engine which I was an investor in Ask Jeeves you know if you can\'t figure that out you\'re crazy.

如果你看一下我们的搜索结果，它们会比我以前的搜索引擎要好得多，我是AskJeeves的投资者，你知道如果你不知道你是不是疯了。

Now I know I figured it out and I knew Ask Jeeves really well the minute we started doing Google searches when we went in to see Larry and Serguei we we said hey can one of our guys play with the search engine.

现在我知道我明白了，我知道，当我们开始谷歌搜索的时候，当我们去看拉里和塞尔盖的时候，我就知道问吉维斯，我们中的一个人能和搜索引擎一起玩吗？

While I talked to Larry and Sergei and just because Google said we\'re based on relevance and page rank those are really easy words today.

当我和拉里和谢尔盖交谈的时候，就因为谷歌说我们是基于相关性和页面排名的，所以今天这些词都很简单。
