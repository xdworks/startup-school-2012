1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990
hi everyone it's awesome to be back here

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,240
was here in 2010 two years ago lots

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,040
changed since then I'm actually gonna

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,500
put this on the ground this is my timer

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:22,859
you see part of being a founder of a

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:25,199
company is solving your own problems so

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,060
I was thinking about this talk and what

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
I would talk about what what the big

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,199
questions would be for me about github

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,690
where we've been where we're going what

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,660
does it mean to to start a company today

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,210
and I figured most of you and especially

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,500
after watching Ben's talk might be

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,289
asking how do I as a budding

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,960
entrepreneur raise a hundred million

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,100
dollars just like github did maybe

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,600
that's the question that you're that

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,250
you're wondering pretty much anywhere I

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,420
go now everyone says hey Tom how's it

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,829
going what are you gonna spend a hundred

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,660
million dollars on but this I think is

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,780
the wrong question I'm not actually

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,729
going to tell you how to do that I'm

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,650
gonna tell you something different and I

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,369
think that's because at the end of the

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,430
day money isn't actually what matters

27
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,189
money is irrelevant what is money money

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,580
is just a number in some banks computer

29
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,369
that says how many slides you can buy

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,869
for your office right but that's not

31
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,000
what we care about that's not what we're

32
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,130
trying to do here we're not trying to

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,820
just make more slides happen in the

34
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,229
world so what does matter I think what

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,939
matters is not the money it's other

36
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,710
things so let's let's think about this I

37
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,540
forgot my clicker I need my clicker this

38
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,659
is gonna be less impactful if I don't

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,899
have my my thing okay thank you sir all

40
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,420
right you guys are in for a treat okay

41
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:00,869
now that I have this okay so let me let

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:06,899
me let me make a positive something for

43
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:10,369
you guys a company is nothing except the

44
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,369
decisions that it makes

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,140
decisions are made by people okay with

46
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,940
me so far

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:25,390
so the only thing that matters our

48
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,360
people people are the only thing that

49
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:33,100
matters and those people then had better

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:36,150
be the right people so let me tell you

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,770
about github in the very early days

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,600
github was started by myself and my

53
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,840
co-founder chris wanstrath initially

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,030
there was two of us what I did was the

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,270
design the front-end the very the just

56
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,650
the visual and the UX I also did the

57
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,780
very back end which is how rails code

58
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,850
accesses git repositories on disk so I'm

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,380
kind of this weird creature and then I

60
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,690
do the front-end stuff and I do the

61
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,790
backend stuff but I've been doing rails

62
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,100
for a long time before that and I didn't

63
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,930
really like it I really like rails you

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:13,780
can tell the world I don't actually like

65
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,670
rails that much and so I was you know in

66
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,260
being in the Ruby community and going to

67
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,600
Ruby meetups this is how I found my

68
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,310
co-founders and chris wanstrath was very

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,200
big into rails he had a blog post that

70
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,820
outlined everything about how to be the

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,130
best rails developer you can be

72
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,140
everything about it was amazing I said

73
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,090
this is a guy that I can start a company

74
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,250
with because we have complementary

75
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,410
skills I'll do the front and back end

76
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,130
he'll do the middle part and together we

77
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,480
have the whole thing and that worked out

78
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,560
really well we just started hacking on

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,020
it on a side side project but then

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,670
shortly thereafter and here's here's a

81
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,110
little tidbit about how can you tell

82
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,060
whether your startup idea is actually

83
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,400
gaining traction how is it how do you

84
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,660
how can you tell if people enjoy it one

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,410
thing that was really effective for us

86
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,810
was when people came to us this is in

87
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,330
the private beta phase and they asked

88
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,250
can I pay for this we had no billing

89
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,900
system and yet they wanted to pay for it

90
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,820
they wanted to make sure that it would

91
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,890
continue to exist so that it would

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,740
continue to solve their problems so if

93
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,470
you have customers asking you to pay for

94
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,820
your company's product before you can

95
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,970
even sell it to them that's a good sign

96
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,250
so in order to a come

97
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,560
in order to get this company to a place

98
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,690
where people could actually buy it we

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,040
hired our third co-founder he came on

100
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,320
board it was just a few months after we

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,940
had started and he as his first thing

102
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,400
built the billing system this is PJ

103
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,320
Hyatt so now he had two rails guys

104
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,510
essentially and me still doing front and

105
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,340
back-end we're building out a better mix

106
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,580
of people and skills to accomplish what

107
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,640
we need to get done our first employee

108
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,040
that we hired name's Scott Chacon he is

109
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,470
a git expert so we reached a level in

110
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,640
the company where we kind of maxed out

111
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,870
our git knowledge none of us would

112
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,510
really get experts and yet we're

113
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,750
building this site github which is for

114
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,060
hosting git repositories so again

115
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,560
through meetups we met Scott we talked

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,450
to him we talked to him about product

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,090
about how he would go about building

118
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,460
things and he was the one that built

119
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,470
gist which is the snippet sharing site

120
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,090
he built that from scratch as his first

121
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:22,940
task bringing his get knowledge into the

122
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,700
equation and so you can see we're

123
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,320
assembling a broader diversity of people

124
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,820
who can accomplish more things we max

125
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,240
out our get knowledge let's bring

126
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,370
someone in that can augment that and

127
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,919
you'll notice that none of these people

128
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,740
none of the four of us were business

129
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,300
people none of us had ever really gone

130
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,620
into business all that much I'd done

131
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,340
some consulting but that doesn't really

132
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,530
count none of us had created large

133
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,840
businesses none of us had an MBA

134
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:56,600
background or a business background like

135
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,780
that so none of us either were

136
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,700
executives none of us had this really

137
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,520
broad experience in creating a company

138
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,900
that you might as a person starting out

139
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,180
think well how are we gonna solve this

140
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,250
problem well let's let's hire an

141
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,600
executive because they know what they're

142
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,600
doing now you have two problems

143
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,840
here's the thing no you know there are

144
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,169
executives and they're awesome great

145
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,020
people but they know so much they know

146
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,090
so much that it can be detrimental I

147
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,889
think to a start-up where you're really

148
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,810
trying to solve a new problem in a

149
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,629
different way you have to come to

150
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,159
problems with beginner's mind right not

151
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:37,770
knowing something can be a very powerful

152
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:40,229
tool in to accomplishing it because you

153
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,659
don't know that it's not possible that's

154
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:44,639
what doing a start-up is not realizing

155
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:48,419
that something is impossible in doing it

156
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,400
anyway something else that was a

157
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:55,050
commonality between us the people in

158
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,810
github in the earliest days was having

159
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,279
worked for bad companies before having

160
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,029
worked in places where they did things

161
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,830
wrong examples of how not to do

162
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:09,689
something are just as good as examples

163
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:12,000
of how to do something and I think this

164
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:14,520
is what companies are for companies

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,370
solve problems great companies solve

166
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:22,680
real problems and if you haven't ever

167
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,500
experienced problems then how can you

168
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,779
know what are the right ones to solve so

169
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,020
you're all here to do startups to join

170
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:33,529
startups to create startups I think that

171
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,699
if your options are creative startup or

172
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,229
try so you know go work for another

173
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,969
company going and working for other

174
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,940
companies is not so bad because it gives

175
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:44,699
you this really excellent perspective on

176
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:48,300
things to not do actually so getting

177
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,460
experience elsewhere not so bad right a

178
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,080
lot of great people that start startups

179
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,939
had a bunch of full time jobs before

180
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,889
that I had five I had five full time

181
00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:01,169
jobs before starting github so suffering

182
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:04,669
can sometimes lead to a better product

183
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,669
for having that information

184
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,040
something that's that's great with

185
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,500
people is getting together we would meet

186
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,480
for beers all the time and we talk over

187
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,120
the problems that we had we go to a bar

188
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,160
called O'Reilly up in North Beach San

189
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,590
Francisco and we just talked through the

190
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,380
big problems right people are very

191
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,870
important having the same ideas for the

192
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,580
product direction is important getting

193
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,870
on the same page for that stuff is

194
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,880
what's gonna allow you to push forward

195
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,410
if you find yourself in a situation

196
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,080
where you're not getting along with your

197
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,150
co-founders or the very small team that

198
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,550
you've created to begin with really step

199
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,870
back and evaluate that problem because I

200
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,000
don't think you can push forward

201
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,910
effectively if you're fighting each

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,250
other right look at that you should be

203
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,540
getting along if you're not really

204
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,250
really think about what that means

205
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,230
hiring is hard hiring the right people

206
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,000
is incredibly hard sometimes you'll

207
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,380
screw it up

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240
we hired a sales person in the very

209
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,250
early days and we had to let him go

210
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,230
because he wasn't the culture fit it was

211
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,360
because we hadn't had experience with

212
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,790
that kind of hiring before and that's

213
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,490
okay you're gonna screw up hiring you

214
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,310
have to be in a place mentally where you

215
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,210
can fix that later on by letting someone

216
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,060
go it sucks

217
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,010
firing people is the worst but if you're

218
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,750
gonna start a company you have to be the

219
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,890
kind of person that can do that when it

220
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:40,620
needs to get done and as your company

221
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,470
matures and you go through these

222
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,850
different phases things are gonna change

223
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,370
your role is going to drastically change

224
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,860
over time in the beginning I described

225
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,840
myself as the janitor I was fixing

226
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,280
things things always need to be fixed I

227
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,320
was always cleaning things up and fixing

228
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,850
things documenting things things are

229
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,130
going so fast that someone has to come

230
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,010
back kind of fix things up every once in

231
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,570
a while I was the janitor and this I

232
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,640
think is why titles are

233
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,290
especially in the beginning of a company

234
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,460
just throw all your titles away don't

235
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,190
even worry about it don't bicker about

236
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,890
who's gonna be the CEO or the CTO or the

237
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,360
CFO all that stuff is crap all that

238
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,070
stuff is crap in the beginning there's

239
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,250
way too much to be done to specialize

240
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,530
that early on things change a little bit

241
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,750
when you get bigger you start to

242
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,640
specialize a little bit more and then

243
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,530
it's really important to think from the

244
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,850
early days do you have the right mix of

245
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,700
personality types

246
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,050
so for us I if I look at the different

247
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
people who are in the company in the

248
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,710
early days and why we've been able to

249
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,110
stay together as a team all four of us

250
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:44,190
are still there today five years later

251
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,560
I'm sort of the logical pragmatic one of

252
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,070
the group Chris is more of the product

253
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,920
visionary one PJ is kind of a business

254
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,020
operations minded person and Scott

255
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,180
guards the culture and creates as much

256
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,090
happiness as possible these are four

257
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,920
sort of different vectors and in having

258
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,960
a discussion and all are just all our

259
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,930
decisions we would make by sitting down

260
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,910
over beers and coming to a conclusion

261
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,160
that was sort of in the middle we would

262
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,420
all check and balance each other so

263
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,430
think about when you're collecting the

264
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,220
right people do they have the right kind

265
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:23,090
of mix to be effective in the long term

266
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:25,800
because that's what you're going for so

267
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,810
always think about how every person can

268
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,980
effectively push the company forward if

269
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,470
you're gonna hire someone how are they

270
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,220
gonna push the company forward because

271
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,640
companies don't do things people do

272
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,010
things and that's why people are all

273
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,840
that matters and so I'm gonna have the

274
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,860
audience help me for this real quick I

275
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,510
want everyone from here over to on the

276
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,390
count of three so one two three and then

277
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,620
go read this off and say people are the

278
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,550
only thing that matters okay are you

279
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:00,720
ready one two three people are the only

280
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:07,440
thing that matters thank you you're an

281
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:09,540
excellent audience but wait customers

282
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,240
don't interact with people not when

283
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:18,330
you're building a product so how can

284
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:21,540
they be the most important thing product

285
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,320
is actually the only thing that matters

286
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,100
ah things are getting interesting I

287
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,019
think when you're thinking about your

288
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,750
product you need to start with design

289
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:35,279
it's how your customers interact with

290
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,649
your products it's what they see it's

291
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,370
what they feel think of it like an

292
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,380
automobile

293
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:44,190
we all understand cars and trucks and

294
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,420
things right this is your this is your

295
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,769
experience this is what you're creating

296
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,139
you're creating something that is like a

297
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,649
vehicle vehicles to us make a lot of

298
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,860
sense

299
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:56,100
they've been refined year over year for

300
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,050
a large part of the last century so they

301
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,730
become very good we all understand them

302
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,800
this is what you're going for a product

303
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,930
that feels so natural that it's like a

304
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,490
car you can just get in you can drive it

305
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,899
off the steering wheels here this pedal

306
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,120
makes you go and this motor pedal makes

307
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:14,880
you stop that's the product and what you

308
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,190
exclude from your product is just as

309
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,730
important as what you include in your

310
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,500
product take for instance Volkswagen the

311
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:27,300
bug that had the little flower vase

312
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,100
right what the hell was that now every

313
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,959
time you get in your car it smells like

314
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,519
dead organic matter and you wonder if

315
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,050
Volkswagen the company is is just the

316
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,600
same thing is this dying company that's

317
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,569
including these crazy things into their

318
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,529
product what you what you leave out is

319
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:51,649
just as important everything that you

320
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:54,810
add makes everything else less important

321
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:57,959
so if you've got your your awesome car

322
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:01,500
right and and you put that big spoiler

323
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,380
on the back then your neon ground

324
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,519
effects aren't gonna be is awesome

325
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:09,089
because people are distracted by the

326
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,260
spoiler so think about that everything

327
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:14,970
that you add dilutes the entire product

328
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,370
our designer our first dedicated

329
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,980
designer that we hired Kyle Neath has a

330
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,160
very nice way of putting this he says

331
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,600
focus over features and I think that's a

332
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,939
very important thing to remember

333
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,550
especially when you're early you can't

334
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:32,819
do everything so the things that you do

335
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,700
had better be awesome they better be the

336
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:36,230
right things and

337
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,580
dilute it by just tacking on every

338
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,710
possible thing that you can think of

339
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,470
thinking that users want just as many

340
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,750
features as possible people want great

341
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,900
products not as many features as they

342
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,660
want if you screw up your design then

343
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,150
you screw up your product so make sure

344
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,360
that one of your co-founders is design

345
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,890
minded for us it was me if you're gonna

346
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,230
do a start-up and you're thinking about

347
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,760
okay I'm a technical guy and I'll you

348
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,230
know I'll hire my technical friends and

349
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,020
we'll start a company together now you

350
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,540
need a designer go find a designer

351
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,070
someone who's gonna make your product

352
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,920
something that customers want to use

353
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,780
instead of stuff like the administrative

354
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,190
screens of open source projects that we

355
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,600
see today this is a big problem with

356
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,700
open source is that there's not a lot of

357
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,510
designers involved that's not what you

358
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,000
want your company to be like another

359
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,560
thing is to think very much about your

360
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,990
mission what is the mission of your

361
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,910
company and I think that you should be

362
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,970
able to say your mission in one sentence

363
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,840
and in fact probably in less than ten

364
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,820
words so for us when github started our

365
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,500
mission was very simple in fact it was

366
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,620
on the website some of you might

367
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,040
remember it said get hosting no longer a

368
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,570
pain in the ass because that was the

369
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,210
core problem that we were trying to

370
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,980
solve make get hosting really easy so

371
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,700
you can share code with your friends it

372
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,200
was a very simple mission over time once

373
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,160
we got further down the road of

374
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:07,040
accomplishing that we started thinking

375
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,630
more about developers as a whole what do

376
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,460
they need to do to be effective at

377
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,280
creating software it's more than just

378
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,050
getting repositories online now it's

379
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,730
about collaboration it's about them

380
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,750
working together and so we changed our

381
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:23,570
mission we stated it as make developers

382
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,180
lives better every day so we expanded

383
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:30,200
the scope of what we were trying to

384
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,120
solve then we started building internal

385
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,180
tools for ourselves things that are

386
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,430
beneficial to creating a software

387
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,020
business and we started thinking about

388
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,030
things a little bit differently still so

389
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,910
we're going broader we started saying we

390
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:46,310
use github to build github because it's

391
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,439
more products than just github calm

392
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,629
things like some things that you have

393
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,230
seen like the job's site jobs at

394
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:53,480
github.com

395
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,370
things like just a bigger suite of

396
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,540
products that can help you solve more

397
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:04,280
problems and now the final vision that

398
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:07,819
we have now is what we call making it

399
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,459
easier to work together than to work

400
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:14,870
alone you'll see that it's completely

401
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,220
divorced from software altogether and so

402
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,240
I will actually answer your question

403
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,449
what are we gonna do with the hundred

404
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,250
million dollars it's that how many

405
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,189
people in the world use code how many

406
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:29,750
people in the world write code thirty

407
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:31,750
million maybe forty if you're lucky how

408
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,919
many people are there in the world

409
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,860
there's a lot more room to fix

410
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,630
collaboration than just software but

411
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,730
this took a long time to get to we

412
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,320
didn't start with this idea of fixing

413
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,419
collaboration for the world we started

414
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,360
with the idea of getting a repository

415
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:51,169
from your computer onto the internet

416
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,480
that was it so remember that when you're

417
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:56,030
solving a problem pick something that

418
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,380
you can solve hopefully there's a

419
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,809
direction that you can go that becomes

420
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,700
bigger right but choose something small

421
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:07,210
in the beginning that you can actually

422
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:10,970
solve if you bootstrap like we did and

423
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:14,240
your product becomes popular then you'll

424
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,429
also be faced with a choice which is are

425
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,020
we going to do this as a lifestyle

426
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,570
business is our product going to be a

427
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,220
lifestyle very niche kind of thing and

428
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,260
yet it'll make your life really your

429
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,399
lives really good you can live with that

430
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,830
with that way that's awesome lots of

431
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:29,360
people do this that's great but you'll

432
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,490
also be faced with the choice which is

433
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,850
do we want to blow this out we want to

434
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,440
change the world if people like your

435
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,270
product you've got a bunch of users

436
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,559
that's a choice that you will have to

437
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:45,649
make I like to think about it like the

438
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,230
TV show Lost how many of you have seen

439
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:52,220
that show lots of you have seen that

440
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,460
show yes I think the saddest thing in

441
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:59,559
the world is a squandered opportunity

442
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,559
and that's what lost was

443
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,650
so that's the question when you're faced

444
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,970
with that choice think about what do you

445
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,440
want to do with your life what are we

446
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:15,000
trying to accomplish I think you're all

447
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,200
here today to solve big problems so

448
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,970
maybe you've already made that choice

449
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,130
but you might have to make it for real

450
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,660
down the road don't squander an

451
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:28,290
opportunity go for it

452
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:29,970
don't be like lost for us it was the

453
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,290
decision to reinvest everything that we

454
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,000
made in the company into the company

455
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,070
instead of banking it out putting in our

456
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,650
bank accounts this is also why we raised

457
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,270
a hundred million dollars because github

458
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:47,220
is an opportunity we don't want to

459
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:51,330
squander it don't worry too much about

460
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,730
when you enter a market almost every

461
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,140
product in the world is terrible look at

462
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,760
the list of products the things that use

463
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:01,309
it every day most of them are just

464
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:04,500
downright crap if you know this and this

465
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:08,550
is something that Apple knows very well

466
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,140
with devices like the iPad right how

467
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:14,550
many tablet computers were there before

468
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:17,450
the iPad dozens all terrible Apple comes

469
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,460
along and through making a good product

470
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,610
day one

471
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,220
that's what product means and that is

472
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,600
why product is all the matters so you

473
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,460
center section on a count of three

474
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:39,480
please help me in saying this phrase one

475
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:41,660
two three product is all the matters but

476
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,660
wait

477
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,409
products only come into being when

478
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,990
people make decisions like we started

479
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:55,799
with and the best decisions are made

480
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:58,770
according to a consistent philosophy so

481
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:03,580
philosophy is all that matters

482
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:05,559
philosophy derives from your people at

483
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,130
github we never set out to create a

484
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:14,289
specific culture the people that we

485
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:16,480
hired created the culture at some point

486
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,580
you might want to codify this culture

487
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,559
that is inherently created through the

488
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,039
people that you hire so that you can

489
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:28,149
communicate it well let me briefly

490
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:32,409
explain what to me the five core values

491
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:34,510
of github are number one optimizing for

492
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:36,309
happiness if you want to learn more

493
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,610
about that watch my talk from two years

494
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:41,409
ago optimizing for happiness means think

495
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,850
about what you're doing and how it's

496
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:46,240
going to create more happiness in the

497
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:50,080
world for your customers for your team

498
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,149
members and for your shareholders if you

499
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,380
do options like most startups do then

500
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,360
your team members are also your

501
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,740
shareholders if you raise money then

502
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,179
your shareholders are part of that

503
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,610
equation as well if you do those things

504
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:07,179
if you optimize for happiness my theory

505
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:10,450
is that profits will result naturally

506
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,090
and it puts you on the right path to do

507
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:16,720
things that matter

508
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:18,789
number two best argument wins this means

509
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,309
that it's not about ego it's not about

510
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:23,529
who you are where you came from it's

511
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:27,159
about making good arguments backing them

512
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:29,730
up and being open to other people's

513
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,500
arguments this is critical to avoiding

514
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,080
politics within a company if you can

515
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,549
argue about something that matters and

516
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,059
the argument is the thing and not the

517
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:41,710
people behind it then you can have good

518
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:44,590
results you can create good product and

519
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:48,309
you can avoid politics number three

520
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:51,010
working from first principles everything

521
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,049
that we do we do from scratch you might

522
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,210
think this is very inefficient sometimes

523
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,860
it is

524
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,900
but we think through every problem that

525
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,000
way because github is a unique company

526
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,640
just like every company is unique you

527
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,930
can't just take the ideas that work for

528
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,120
some other company and apply them to

529
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,380
yourself and in fact you can't take the

530
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,540
ideas that I give you today or that

531
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,450
anyone gives you today and just copy

532
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,970
them and expect them to work for you you

533
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:20,560
have to think about what it means for

534
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:24,070
your company this is how you create

535
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,580
something new something better number

536
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,840
four create superfans

537
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,360
Travis's talk about uber and how they

538
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,970
delight their users on certain holidays

539
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,440
giving them a motorcade that's the kind

540
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,820
of stuff that I'm talking about for us

541
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,880
we do drink ups it's like a meetup

542
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,500
accepted to the bar and we buy you beer

543
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,970
for developers this turns out to be

544
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,830
incredibly effective that's just one of

545
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,960
many things how we deal with support

546
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,720
what I love about our support team is

547
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,600
that we measure our success the success

548
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,540
of a support interaction by Counting how

549
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,170
many explode exclamation points are in

550
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,790
the response from an end user that's

551
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,340
creating superfans creating that kind of

552
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:14,140
experience that goes above and beyond

553
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:17,650
what is expected and number five be

554
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:21,010
awesome and change the world that one's

555
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,990
pretty self-explanatory so if you have a

556
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,510
strong culture you can use it as a

557
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,610
hiring tool it's amazingly effective and

558
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,200
this is really critical today as it

559
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,450
becomes more and more difficult to hire

560
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,460
as all of you who would normally be

561
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,260
entering the workforce are instead

562
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,080
starting your own companies the pool of

563
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:41,710
candidates is smaller the competition is

564
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,980
higher since the early days of github

565
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,650
we've evangelized our way of working our

566
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,030
culture and our values and the

567
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,760
philosophy that gives us that higher

568
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,130
purpose all of this allows you to

569
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,340
attract the kind of people that

570
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:59,440
naturally fit your philosophy and so

571
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,870
those people that you're attracting

572
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,800
through this communication will make the

573
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,710
right kinds of decisions

574
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,620
and since decisions are how make people

575
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:12,250
make products the philosophy that guides

576
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,070
those decisions is all that matters

577
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:22,580
so please third segment of the audience

578
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:27,230
on three one two three philosophy is all

579
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:32,540
that matters I'm not convinced that you

580
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:34,250
believe it but okay so I've told you

581
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,120
three things that are the only things

582
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,620
that matter how can that possibly be

583
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,800
which of these things three things is

584
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,090
the only thing that matters I don't

585
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,930
think I have to answer that question I

586
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:51,920
think it's a false trichotomy someone

587
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,470
really enjoyed that joke

588
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,670
thank you hold on I'm not done yet hold

589
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:01,720
on hold on hold hold on I'm not just

590
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:07,570
gonna end on false dichotomy okay

591
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:10,750
in reality in reality just like the

592
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:17,139
three quarks of an atom cannot exist on

593
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:23,529
their own people product and philosophy

594
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:24,730
are also inseparable so do you guys

595
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:27,789
remember what was the only thing that

596
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,159
mattered people do you guys remember the

597
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:31,360
only thing that mattered product do you

598
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,750
guys remember the only thing that

599
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,529
mattered philosophy on three everybody

600
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:47,399
say what you said before together one

601
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:49,870
two three if you master these things

602
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:54,399
then you will finally have the answer to

603
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,919
the question how do I raise 100 million

604
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:59,039
dollars

605
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,039
thank you
