1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,990
thank you for coming thank you very much

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,359
for inviting so many people there's a

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,259
lot of people so maybe to start you

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,760
could just tell us a little bit about

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,990
what Rakatan is and how you got started

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,109
okay so I found it in Iraq then in 1997

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,529
as a matter of fact you know I was

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:24,840
trying to partner with one of you found

9
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,939
a program and you know my concept was to

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,090
recreate what we call internet shopping

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:34,649
mall or in Japan and it was very very

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:38,070
and the early days and we try to do is

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,430
fall for viruses it didn't go through so

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,879
we started to hire you know young

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,530
graduate school students started from

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,210
initial capital of 200,000 USD never

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,420
raised any money from any VC just hired

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,809
young guys and went public in 2000 and

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,659
started to you know buy many companies

20
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:08,520
now we are number one in ecommerce about

21
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,310
35 to 40 percent market share in terms

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,580
of e-commerce number one on my travel

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,780
number one in only banking number two in

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,659
only brokerage and we do about 38

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,960
different businesses in Japan

26
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:31,450
and we sell to globalize our business so

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:34,689
now we are in more than 13 countries we

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,530
bought the second largest even a company

29
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:44,710
called Kobo which is extremely well in

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:47,679
Europe in Canada in in Asia so we are a

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:51,310
little bit different Internet company in

32
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:54,100
Japan and now trying to globalize our

33
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,229
business how it's starting the company

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,259
in Japan and growing a company in Japan

35
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,799
different than Silicon Valley well you

36
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:05,950
know there is no really you know venture

37
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,849
capital ecosystem no no there are

38
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:14,290
venture capitals but but not like you

39
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:17,950
know i you know ii body-type sort of

40
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:21,400
food service pcs they will invest but

41
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,540
not much they will not get involved into

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,269
the management that much so just kind of

43
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,760
providing the capital so how did you

44
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,049
learn the lessons that VC's in Silicon

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,549
Valley tradition traditionally help

46
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,620
entrepreneurs well how did you learn how

47
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,150
to run a company and grow it I don't

48
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,120
know how she invited me she's are

49
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,810
helping VC venture companies because I

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,940
have never experienced but the way again

51
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:52,000
I found it acting with my own you know

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:56,709
the money initial capital was just two

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,040
hundred thousand USD but since I knew

54
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:03,130
that I am NOT going to be funded a huge

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,680
amount from VC I created sort of cash

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:11,560
flow system so that I don't need to rely

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,769
on NBC we asked our merchants to pay

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,690
five hundred dollars per month but we

59
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,780
asked them to pay us six months up front

60
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,030
so from the second months of our service

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,319
my company was cashflow positive

62
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,880
you can cash faster every month since

63
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,880
yes very impressive

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,700
is there any looking back to that first

65
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:37,560
year you know when you were sort of

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,170
becoming cashflow positive very quickly

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,519
and figuring this out as you went are

68
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,290
there any things that stick out that you

69
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,930
would do differently well so again we

70
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,810
never raised any money from outside we

71
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,359
raised later on from friends and

72
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,519
families we didn't need any money but

73
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:00,900
this was kind of just a you know for the

74
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:05,280
friendship for sake which I want to make

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,629
my family and my friends happy but how

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
far along were you when you did that

77
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,879
friends and family around no that was

78
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,879
like six months before we go public yeah

79
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:21,060
two days before we our IPO my friend

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,599
masses on Softbank call me and ask me to

81
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:31,320
let him in but I said it's too late but

82
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:33,389
well we were very patient to be honest

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:39,270
we were very patient for the first three

84
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:43,650
years and try to be create the you know

85
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,370
kernel of our business model so we're

86
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,409
not trying to copy the with the model

87
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:53,460
amazon.com or eBay we're trying to

88
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:55,440
create a great system to support medium

89
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,610
to small size merchants to sell their

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,979
product all over Japan so we we try to

91
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,770
create an extremely strong culture of

92
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,229
the company because I knew that I'm

93
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,409
going to be in this business for a long

94
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:13,530
long time so we didn't rush we were very

95
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:15,150
patient did you figure out that kernel

96
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,099
on the first try that you get right the

97
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,020
thing that made rocket and what it is

98
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,930
the first strategy of to iterate and

99
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,440
evolve to get well one thing we did

100
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,900
differently from most of us base

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,810
ecommerce company is we try to

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,950
facilitate the communication between the

103
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:37,680
merchants and consumers because

104
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,320
the way I feel is of course in buying

105
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,050
products price is important the

106
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,200
efficiency is important but more than

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,230
that in my opinion the buy thing you

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,730
know should be fun and we need to create

109
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:56,510
a very rich experience so we try to be a

110
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,720
liason between the consumer and the

111
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,760
retailer

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,730
instead of you know trying to compete

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,250
against the retailer using the ID we

114
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,590
want to use our technology to help small

115
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,480
to medium-sized enterprise do business

116
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:13,710
with consumers so that was totally

117
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:18,150
different idea and I was 100% confident

118
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,210
my employees will really like the idea

119
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,980
of helping small to medium sized

120
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,200
companies rather than trying to destroy

121
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,850
their business so I mean as you said

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
this is very different than anyone else

123
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,350
was doing any commerce at the time

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,310
really still is did you know that that

125
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,360
that was going to be the model you're

126
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,670
going to after before you started the

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,750
company was that were you convinced that

128
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,440
this was what you were going to do

129
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,240
differently we didn't think about how

130
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,670
we're gonna do it differently but we

131
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,440
know what we wanted to do I always don't

132
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,720
think about our competitor that much

133
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,430
because you know you cannot do too many

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,540
things about that right you just need to

135
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,910
focus on what you do to improve your you

136
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,650
know service and improve customer

137
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,430
satisfaction I think that's part of

138
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:06,030
nature of Japanese companies keep

139
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,770
improving improving improving how did

140
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,180
you grow and it both in the early days

141
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,230
when you were signing up these small and

142
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,130
medium businesses that you wanted to

143
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,430
help and then in the later days

144
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,510
obviously you made a lot of acquisitions

145
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,970
to help drive growth could you just talk

146
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,740
about how you figured out growth all

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,080
along the way well of course we have a

148
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,340
organic growth and we buy many companies

149
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,330
and domestically and internationally

150
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:32,970
domestically we created three things one

151
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:36,490
great brand by the way we have a

152
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:40,180
professional baseball covering egos

153
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,220
and so everybody knows rockland brand

154
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,819
even if you don't use Internet they know

155
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,099
rafting brand we host a TV 500 tennis

156
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,110
tournament so we have extremely strong

157
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:55,000
band too

158
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:57,430
we created the strongest mileage reward

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,740
program conducting super points so we

160
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:05,130
can use those points to cross-sell our

161
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:07,690
service and we also created the sort of

162
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:12,340
the consumer database to analyze

163
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:15,430
consumer data and now about 880 million

164
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,190
so about 90 percent of internet

165
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,800
populations are our member and we can

166
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:25,780
use our currency our points to

167
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,789
cross-sell virus service to them back to

168
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,259
the topic of acquisitions what do you

169
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,720
look for when you make an acquisition

170
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,310
and and how do you integrate the the

171
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,440
company into rocket 10 so that you're

172
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,839
all one company together also there's

173
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,050
two types of Ephesians we make one is

174
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,570
period geographic expansion to buy a

175
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:47,589
time so we bought a five calm in the US

176
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:51,070
play calm you can press Minister in

177
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:55,450
France and really try to use their

178
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:58,540
presence and brand name and the their

179
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,630
presence and and convert their business

180
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:06,220
model to lock the model the second type

181
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:10,270
is addition to our ecosystem a very

182
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,760
chain like cobol which is not doing as

183
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,709
well as in other countries but they are

184
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,480
very strong they have more market share

185
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:23,950
and in Canada and in France and the in

186
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:28,990
Japan so we need we knew that we need a

187
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:33,190
digital book service in our sort of a

188
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:37,720
product lineup so and we know that we

189
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:41,620
can use our membership to facilitate the

190
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,810
growth of cocoa business so so there is

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,360
two types geographic expansion

192
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,790
to buy a time and also addition to our

193
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,350
ecosystem and then once you make these

194
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,720
acquisitions how do you integrate them

195
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:58,600
into the culture of Rakatan mission

196
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,630
practice and value so before buying a

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,930
company we talk about our dream and goal

198
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,880
and our culture and talk over and over

199
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,160
and over again before we make our

200
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,040
questions if they don't like our culture

201
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,570
or our practice or mission we are not

202
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,580
we're going to buy even if you like that

203
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,220
service because it's it doesn't make

204
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,040
sense to lose the you know founders and

205
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,400
and management of your company so we we

206
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,700
talked over before the closure of the

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,650
deal

208
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,750
we talked a lot about those kind of

209
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,130
things and what's your success rate for

210
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,839
acquisitions in terms of good

211
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:38,080
integration on those points Oh difficult

212
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,830
question I don't know but they're still

213
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:46,230
on their work one you know only one

214
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:48,940
failure we made was we went into China

215
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,430
partnering with Baidu which is largest

216
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,710
search engine company in China but it

217
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,720
didn't work out well so we all we

218
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,820
discussed with them and agree that we

219
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,520
should shut the business down and we

220
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:06,850
withdrew from China yet year ago so

221
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:08,380
that's is the only you know the big

222
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:13,120
failure

223
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,589
I recognize at this moment even more

224
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
than the sort of the tree culture I'll

225
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,190
use you've talked about you know one

226
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,390
thing that I just heard again and again

227
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,160
is that Rakatan is known for having

228
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,410
having a great culture could you talk

229
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,180
about how you've held that culture all

230
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,820
the way through for the last 15 years as

231
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,110
you said how do you think about the

232
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,100
culture the company needs to be to be

233
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:36,700
success to have to be successful so in

234
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:40,209
my opinion you need have two things one

235
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,330
is of course innovation and the second

236
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:46,000
part is operation and the innovation is

237
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,520
kind of not so difficult to encourage

238
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,260
people to be innovative but at the same

239
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,460
time if you want to scale your business

240
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,970
you need to have a

241
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,370
strong operation culture as well and you

242
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,430
wanted to achieve strong operation

243
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:06,190
culture you need to have sort of you

244
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:09,850
know the shared practices and the you

245
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:13,600
know it's kind of a the framework for

246
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,450
managing the company probably mainly

247
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,230
using more numbers and KPIs but most

248
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,850
likely the entrepreneurs don't like you

249
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,820
know just running in the numbers but I

250
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,390
think you know being you know

251
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:32,410
quantitative analytical qualitative is

252
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:34,420
also very important so recently you

253
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,399
invested in Pinterest could you talk a

254
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,230
little bit about how that came together

255
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,000
and and what you see in Pinterest and

256
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,850
how you hope the relationship is going

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,860
to evolve well I think Pinterest of

258
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,680
course been spoke I just had a phone

259
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,970
call with him and I think he was great

260
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,470
he's great we like the company and I

261
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,850
think Pinterest is very different from

262
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:01,150
other social networks it's very you know

263
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,790
graphical and appeals to the heart of

264
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:07,209
your interest and it has a strong

265
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,730
influence over to buying behavior and

266
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,630
buying decisions of the people so as an

267
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,459
e-commerce company

268
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,709
I think the Pinterest is the best social

269
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,800
network so we found Pinterest and I had

270
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:19,620
a meeting with Ben had a drink and Cara

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:28,500
okay and

272
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:32,670
and he liked me he led us in whatever I

273
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,220
think maybe has been but he he saw I

274
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,480
think he had seen something different in

275
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:42,410
us you know compared with other US based

276
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,940
internet companies or VCS I will ask him

277
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,550
what do you see is the big challenges

278
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,860
and the opportunities in retail and

279
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:53,190
e-commerce coming down over the next few

280
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:57,000
years of course you know I think this is

281
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,800
the stage stage one for e-commerce now

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,160
we are seeing a lot of these content

283
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,180
sales so the books CDs DVDs games

284
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,070
everything will be digital and online

285
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,890
definitely the logistics will become

286
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,480
more and more important and there are

287
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:19,370
lots of innovative logistics companies

288
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:24,540
using you know robots and automation to

289
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:27,420
you know we improve the efficiency and

290
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,290
also the devices the mobile phones

291
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,110
smartphones the tablet will become the

292
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,710
major device to divide products and

293
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:42,150
maybe there will be a certain social I

294
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:45,810
think the social shopping is still

295
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:49,080
nobody we find the strong answer to it

296
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,640
but I think individually will come for

297
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,380
for social shopping or anything else are

298
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,270
the other major ways you identified the

299
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,100
Japanese consumers behave differently

300
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,550
than consumers anywhere else in the

301
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,840
world

302
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:04,890
well Lockton is what I call very shop

303
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:09,120
centric marketplace meaning that there

304
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:11,850
every shop have a very different you

305
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,570
know characters and also the design and

306
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,960
the user experience and we provided all

307
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:23,350
sorts of tools for them to make fans

308
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,740
around shop so I think wrapping

309
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:29,350
was very social from the day one we try

310
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,920
to create a fans around shops not around

311
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,050
Rockland OCAP but the fans around shops

312
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,420
and all these shops has what you know

313
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,120
professional staff and they are the sort

314
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,460
of curator of the wines or sports in

315
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,000
goods or you know groceries and so forth

316
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,500
so I think my question is so if you want

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,290
to buy some product do you want to ask

318
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,470
your friend or do you want to ask the

319
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,310
staff at Pro Shop and my of course

320
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,740
sometimes your friend is can give you

321
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,610
better advice than this staff at the Pro

322
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:07,030
Shop but most time you know I think you

323
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,360
know we usually ask professionals so

324
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,970
that was our approach and I think it

325
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,070
worked extremely well in Japan and now

326
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,750
we're testing in other countries and I

327
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,320
think it's it's working very well as

328
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,610
well and can you talk you talked a

329
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,700
little bit about mobile and tablets but

330
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,470
obviously in Japan that's become a huge

331
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,000
way that people are not in you know

332
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,170
probably even bigger than here where it

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,210
seems like our own right on the phone

334
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,320
all the time how much are you thinking

335
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,700
about mobile and how are you thinking

336
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,540
about mobile is sort of the future of

337
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,570
the company

338
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,330
well already 25% of rocked and

339
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,190
transaction which is big we do about 15

340
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,170
billion USD or

341
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,900
even more this year just for pure

342
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:51,150
e-commerce in Japan and already 25

343
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:53,920
percent of transaction is coming from

344
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,250
mobile devices including feature phone

345
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,390
smart phone maybe a 60% for smartphone

346
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:04,840
and 40% a future phone and smartphone

347
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:08,200
transaction is growing about 300 to 400

348
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:11,250
percent year-on-year so it will be more

349
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:15,820
than 50 percent within a couple of years

350
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:17,140
it's huge we that is HUGE you said

351
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,370
something earlier that was so

352
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,770
interesting to me I made a note to go

353
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,640
back to it which is that you did you

354
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,400
don't think a lot about competition

355
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,340
because you can't do much about that one

356
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,920
thing that I start ups all the time is

357
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,540
fear about competition so when you were

358
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,000
starting the company and Amazon and eBay

359
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,140
were were huge was that a problem for

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,700
you do people ask you what are you gonna

361
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,789
do about

362
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,929
on ebay you know how are you gonna beat

363
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:42,600
them how you can compete with them and

364
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:44,309
how did you think about sort of how did

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,340
you stay focused on doing your own thing

366
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:50,730
and ignoring competition well let me put

367
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,940
it I learn from competitors but I'm not

368
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,399
afraid of competitors because even if

369
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,909
you're afraid of it doesn't be any good

370
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,850
for you

371
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:04,700
so I learned what they're doing and then

372
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:09,389
maybe you know try to match if I have to

373
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:11,490
but I think the the way we approach if

374
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:14,159
commerce is totally different from

375
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,039
amazon.com because again we are trying

376
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,929
to facilitate the transaction with

377
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,970
medium to small merchants to the larger

378
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:28,169
ones to the consumers as a consequence

379
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:31,169
you know we have big brands almost all

380
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:35,130
department stores big a big fashion

381
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:37,769
brands almost entire a photonic

382
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,169
companies are using a platform but that

383
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:43,710
and that's major portion of our business

384
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:45,870
but approaches to how to help small to

385
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:51,299
medium-sized merchants to do business

386
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:53,460
with the consumers so but let's see I

387
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,580
think we have a philosophical difference

388
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,070
between ourselves and amazon.com so I'm

389
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,809
not very afraid of them but we I'm

390
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:06,230
always thinking about how we can scale

391
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,230
our business

392
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,260
how would you know a time by the way

393
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,940
five

394
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,590
let's see what's most interesting here

395
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,840
we were talking a little bit backstage

396
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,300
about just sort of Japanese culture and

397
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,170
the differences between starting a

398
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,870
startup here and we talked about

399
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,020
investing could you talk about hiring

400
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,400
and how you hired the initial people and

401
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,650
especially in a culture where joining a

402
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,380
start-up is not as cool as it was maybe

403
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:36,640
now as it is in the valley

404
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,990
well now of course it's different from

405
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,060
fifteen years ago when I started a

406
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:45,580
company you know nobody wanted work for

407
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,250
small startups but now they have seen

408
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,730
many successes and there are so many

409
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,920
young people who wanna work for the you

410
00:19:51,730 --> 00:20:00,880
know startups and ventures and so forth

411
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:06,070
I think the way I am in hiring in

412
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:09,010
younger people and not not to hire the

413
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,850
meet - you know upper aged people as

414
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:15,370
much as possible because I knew that we

415
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,950
want to impress our original corporate

416
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,420
culture so that wasn't very important

417
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,180
for me to hire younger people and

418
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,130
educate them especially nowadays after

419
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,960
we went public we started to hire many

420
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,460
more we got great great hair people and

421
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,320
you know we because we need that we have

422
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:37,870
more professional expertise and two and

423
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,000
a half years ago we announced that we

424
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,190
are going to convert internal

425
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,340
communication language from Japanese to

426
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,580
English and this was a big splash in the

427
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:51,640
Japanese society and some CEOs you know

428
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:56,790
you know explicitly announce that we are

429
00:20:51,640 --> 00:21:01,360
crazy company as well as we are but now

430
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:04,570
70% of new engineers joining Sarno in

431
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,240
Japanese 30% of new employees are non

432
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,700
Japanese so we had to decolonize in our

433
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,110
you know recruitment mark zuckerberg a

434
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,420
few years ago made a comment about

435
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,860
hiring young people preferentially and

436
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,260
it was the all that the press talked

437
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,140
about for two weeks so maybe you'll be

438
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,950
featured a lot now

439
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,510
I'm talking on that why did you make

440
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,150
that decision to make English the

441
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:32,130
official language of the company well so

442
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:34,770
the thing I have done in Japan is we try

443
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,200
to create an open culture company so we

444
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,660
discuss almost all information to entire

445
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,210
employees so the people who is doing

446
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,210
e-commerce know what's going on for our

447
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,910
banking business and we cost share all

448
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,710
these expertise and plat forces as

449
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:55,680
possible you know web marketing you know

450
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:58,080
engineering and so forth and so forth

451
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,030
so that was our strength how common is

452
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,990
that for Japanese companies to do to

453
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,150
share everything openly

454
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,610
well sharing the code opening up is very

455
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:10,110
common and we call this Yoko 10 meaning

456
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:13,230
a horizontal particle you know transfer

457
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,780
of expertise I think that is one of the

458
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,330
strengths of Japanese company because

459
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,290
you know it's not good or bad it's not

460
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:25,860
so performance oriented devious system

461
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:28,740
and I wanted to do this globally but I

462
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,220
couldn't because most of the expertise

463
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:35,250
is in Japan and our most of our stuff

464
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,490
cannot communicate in English so you

465
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,260
know I was kind of liason between our

466
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,210
global business and Japanese business

467
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,850
and I was getting really tired just you

468
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,120
know talking you know and being

469
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:50,350
translating everything and so one day I

470
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,179
woke up and

471
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:56,080
you know thought about everything in

472
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:58,600
English and so I stood in front of

473
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,450
entire services employees and told them

474
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,429
I am going to convert the offshore

475
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,340
business language of rockton from

476
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:10,169
Japanese to English almost the reaction

477
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:15,309
in that room was very quiet very quiet

478
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:17,740
but has totally changed the TOEIC score

479
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:19,690
of our employees improve almost 200

480
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,570
points for the last two years

481
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:27,759
what score sir I said I got English test

482
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:30,039
you know and most of the staff can

483
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,649
manage to communicate in English they

484
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,179
are not afraid of you know going abroad

485
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:37,799
or joining to the international

486
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:41,289
conference now we have so many people

487
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:44,409
you know in Japanese foreigners in their

488
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:48,009
Tokyo office and now they started to

489
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:50,049
benchmark international failures instead

490
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:52,240
of domestic players so I thought I

491
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,690
changed that's great one last question

492
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,360
we were talking backstage and the last

493
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,639
time that Paul and Miki met was 16 or 17

494
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,480
years ago when Paul was working on dia

495
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:05,679
web so Paul loves to ask people at these

496
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,539
what was someone so like the first time

497
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,740
you met them so finally we get to ask

498
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:13,529
what Paul Graham is like so it's in the

499
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,539
Harvard Business School case so I

500
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:18,940
initially when after I left my bank I

501
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,769
started sort of a you know business

502
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,740
consulting firm and I was looking for

503
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:27,820
something new to do and you know came up

504
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,159
with the internet shopping idea and one

505
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,840
of my classmate at Harvard Business

506
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,210
School call me

507
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,129
Miki you need to look at this company

508
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,919
it's called file web and it's my

509
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:42,340
friend's company so I went via web calm

510
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,940
and look at me like that next day I put

511
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:49,480
a economy class airplane ticket and flew

512
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,789
over to Boston and I visited four and it

513
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,470
was five people company and we kind of

514
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:57,909
agree that we're gonna do things

515
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,670
together but the last minute you know

516
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:03,210
poor were supposed to

517
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:06,530
come over to Japan but at the airport he

518
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,530
found out his passport is expired

519
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:13,470
that's why you couldn't come and somehow

520
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:16,770
the deal didn't go through so but I feel

521
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:22,400
that was a really the first moment I

522
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:25,260
fell I met the the truly strong

523
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:30,060
entrepreneur and I felt the excitement

524
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:33,650
and energy important in his team that

525
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,650
