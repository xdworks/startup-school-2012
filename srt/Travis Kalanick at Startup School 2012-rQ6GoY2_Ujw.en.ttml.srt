1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,140
wow this is awesome okay this place is

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,360
full all right so good to meet all of

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,349
you my name is Travis Connick co-founder

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,430
CEO of uber let's see so I do a lot of

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,500
speaking because we are we're a

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,750
technology company that is we're in the

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,900
trenches we're in the cities you know

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,920
more than half of our employees are not

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,510
in San Francisco I almost I don't even

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,329
remember the last time I spoke in San

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,020
Francisco in front of an audience every

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,090
time I go to speak somewhere right I

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,649
look I go on Google and I look at the

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,390
roads I look at architecture I look at

15
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,760
cool pictures I can put that are iconic

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,610
I'm going to speak in Silicon Valley and

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,140
I'm searching Google Images and I can't

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:00,030
find anything and so yeah there you go

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,460
it's good to be here all right anyways I

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,460
found a little something all right so

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,170
guys I'm guessing most people here at

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,020
least know what uber is but for those of

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,970
you who don't I'm going to go do a sort

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:18,090
of a basic tour just really quick it's

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,880
an app on your iPhone that helps you get

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,060
a car our motto is everyone's private

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,409
driver and so you you open up the app

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,049
and you see a bunch of cars that are

29
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:33,540
near you this is one of San Francisco

30
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:35,400
cars three minutes away and Jim will

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,409
arrive in two minutes he's rated at four

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,110
point eight and this is all of course

33
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,119
all screenshots from your app when he

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,770
arrives you're told you're notified you

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,689
can call the driver of course and if

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,689
you're lucky he'll open the door for you

37
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,040
when you're done this is a short trip

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,960
$15 that's our minimum in San Francisco

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,820
of course we have lower-cost options now

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,189
we have something called uber X a couple

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,140
days ago we launched taxi in San

42
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,840
Francisco for a lot of folks are like

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,460
you're doing tax easier the anti taxi

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,700
what are you doing we know what we're

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,710
doing but

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,920
we'll get to that in just a second all

47
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:16,010
right so some basics launched in June

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,840
2010 so we're we're just over two years

49
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,610
old

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,290
we don't own cars we don't employ

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,020
drivers a lot of people don't know that

52
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,840
about us I think we we have all these

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,190
assets they think that we employ lots of

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,470
drivers we don't we have 120 employees

55
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,340
most of which are not in San Francisco

56
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,110
we don't have a marketing spend we're

57
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,440
deployed in 17 cities for some reason

58
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,500
they're 16 here we actually just soft

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,760
launched in Sydney a couple days ago

60
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:52,310
actually yet yesterday Amsterdam is

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,900
coming very very shortly and I think

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,190
Minneapolis isn't on here we did that a

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,270
couple weeks ago so quick numbers

64
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,630
hundreds of thousands of hours driven

65
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,700
per week a very interesting engagement

66
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,360
figure 50% of all the people who have

67
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,090
ever ridden on uber have ridden in the

68
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,549
last 30 days and remember when you ride

69
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,320
your pain so think about commerce think

70
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,570
about a commerce site or a commerce app

71
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,780
or 50% of the people who've ever paid

72
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,480
paid in the last 30 days average person

73
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,890
is paying about 105 dollars a month in

74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,890
San Francisco it's a bit higher than

75
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,739
that prices are probably a bit too high

76
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,540
I know some of you have felt that sting

77
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,140
we're doing 26 percent month-over-month

78
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,560
growth that's an average over the last

79
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,330
now 16 17 months you go okay well if you

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,250
start really low and you can grow really

81
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,900
big but we were pretty big twelve months

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,910
ago and if you do 26 percent

83
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,590
month-over-month growth that means in 12

84
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,320
months you're 16 times bigger than you

85
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,630
were 12 months ago so we're growing fast

86
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,810
and in fact September over August was 29

87
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,250
percent month-over-month so I'm going to

88
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,260
tell a little bit about our background

89
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,790
and then hopefully if I have enough time

90
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,290
get into some of the regulatory stuff

91
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,799
which I know none of you guys want to

92
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,880
hear about all right so this you can't

93
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,459
see really well because of all the

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,890
lights but it's a romantic shot from the

95
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,390
Eiffel Tower between with me and my

96
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,130
co-founder Garrett camp some of you guys

97
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,849
may know who's the founder of

98
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,190
StumbleUpon

99
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:20,579
it was in Paris at LeWeb where we came

100
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,259
up with this idea

101
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,569
essentially you know he said look I just

102
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,490
want to push a button and get a ride you

103
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,370
know let's and let's make it a classy

104
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,960
ride and that's kind of how we started

105
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,599
Paris in many ways is a sister city of

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,500
San Francisco impossible to get a cab

107
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:40,590
there so this is something from the past

108
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,169
this is what we call hailing I'm not

109
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,849
sure if you guys have ever done that but

110
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,860
some people actually put their arm out

111
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,810
to get a cab I don't I don't know what's

112
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,939
going on it's a weird thing but this is

113
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,159
what we used to see in San Francisco I

114
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,740
went through that when we first started

115
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,210
actually it wasn't about taking over the

116
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,710
world it wasn't about taking on

117
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,349
corruption in every city around the

118
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,099
world it was actually just about being

119
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:07,979
baller in San Francisco and the only way

120
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:11,219
to do it the original idea was let's go

121
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:14,969
buy 10s classes let's hire 20 drivers

122
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:17,520
and let's get a parking garage and I'm

123
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:20,009
like Garrett we're not buying any car

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,520
student and we're not signing any lease

125
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:25,080
on a parking garage but the idea of

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,900
pushing a button getting a ride in

127
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,460
within minutes was a magical one and at

128
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,289
the beginning it was lifestyle thing it

129
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,240
was s classes for us and our hundred

130
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,310
friends and so that's where it started

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,479
in order to use the app you anybody

132
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,339
could download it but in order to use it

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,849
you had us have a special code that I

134
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,440
gave you and pretty soon the inbox was

135
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,270
just getting full of people who wanted

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,580
the code because our friends were

137
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,409
telling their friends and then you know

138
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,020
I searched on Google Images my favorite

139
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:55,319
thing Xplosive viral growth on the

140
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,409
Internet and there you go that was the

141
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,870
best one I could find we have this thing

142
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:03,990
called God view this is an older version

143
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,580
of God view you can see much more what's

144
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,419
going on today but I can't show you the

145
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,419
new version of God view it's too intense

146
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:15,150
but this is a screenshot of a Friday

147
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,520
night very soon after we launched maybe

148
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,419
a few weeks or something like that we

149
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,839
had four trips going on at the same time

150
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,169
we were going nuts like there's four

151
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,909
trips there's like we got trips going on

152
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,129
we got to dispatch the Green Line at the

153
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:33,869
top there that's a dispatch

154
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:35,669
he shouldn't have his arm up but he does

155
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:37,649
but he's got it he's got a bill

156
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:41,519
briefcase which is cool

157
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:46,739
that's Friday night early on and now

158
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,999
this is 5:00 a.m. on a Monday the

159
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,479
eyeballs by the way you see some

160
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,039
eyeballs

161
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,009
every once in a while in there that's

162
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,409
somebody opening an app so we see when

163
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,569
people open apps that helps us in demand

164
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,949
prediction remember we're a logistics

165
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,669
company or what I'd call it we were

166
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:06,509
building an urban logistics fabric so

167
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:09,629
when you do something successful not

168
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:14,669
everybody's happy and the older the

169
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:16,830
industry you're tackling the the more

170
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:19,860
protected it is by government or by

171
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,979
corruption or by both the more they're

172
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,599
going to be upset about what you do

173
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:25,709
we're making drivers lives a hell of a

174
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,029
lot better they're making a lot more

175
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,949
money they're making ends meet they're

176
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,839
living their American dream and uber is

177
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,399
helping them do that riders are getting

178
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,219
around town much more efficiently I'm

179
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,990
not sure who hurts from this other than

180
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:41,819
a particular incumbent industry which I

181
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,829
will mention so a few metrics look when

182
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,999
I'm having a bad day I just go to our

183
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,999
overall revenue graph

184
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,539
uh this is a cool trick in Photoshop if

185
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:05,340
you take that image and you flip it it's

186
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:08,639
like a smile okay all right that's just

187
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,800
gratuitous okay look we launched in

188
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
Sanford oh by the way so this this is

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,580
what 26 percent month-over-month growth

190
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,710
looks like and a lot of times when I

191
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,139
show this when I when I do presentations

192
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,479
in cities we every time we launch in a

193
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,210
city we do this big launch event sort of

194
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:27,060
have some high rollers and people who

195
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,949
really make the city move we sort of pay

196
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,900
our respects to that city and and do a

197
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,000
really nice dinner and and these folks

198
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,700
are always leaning to the left looking

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,229
for the axis when we first launched

200
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,209
first of all a lot of people go wow it's

201
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,730
successful that's so obvious I call it

202
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,050
the the hand to the palm to forehead

203
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,420
moment when they learn about uber

204
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,029
they're like I had this idea or I should

205
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,779
have had this idea when we first

206
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,510
launched guys

207
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,209
it wasn't easy getting our angel round

208
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:03,300
people thought we were crazy limos in

209
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:04,890
San Francisco what but it took off like

210
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,500
I said and so one of the interesting

211
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,029
things before we went to our series a or

212
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,220
sorry this is actually before our series

213
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,890
be here which we did in November of last

214
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,140
year was is this a one-hit-wonder or not

215
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,420
is this only going to work in San

216
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,310
Francisco because it's so screwed up and

217
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,640
so we started launching in other cities

218
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,830
and this is a Revenue chart on a weekly

219
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,570
it's a weekly window or which you could

220
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,670
think of it's like I'm almost a moving

221
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:36,360
average blue is San Francisco yellow is

222
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,279
New York this was early on the brown is

223
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,190
Seattle and the green they're Chicago

224
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,360
now obviously we're way past that now

225
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,760
this was like sort of the first hundred

226
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,250
days but what we found is that every

227
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,089
city we were rolling out or just hey we

228
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,000
didn't know if it was going to work

229
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:54,000
every city we're rolling out got

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,550
progressively better our operations side

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,910
of the house got very efficient and then

232
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,500
the technology and the number of people

233
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,240
who knew about us when we go in we went

234
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,980
into New York we had a thousand people

235
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,120
with credit cards on file without a car

236
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,759
on the ground

237
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,959
so this wasn't a one-hit wonder and so

238
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,720
we just started launching a ton of

239
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:18,749
cities we have this double rainbow of

240
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,930
metrics what does it mean remember as

241
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:23,999
liquidity goes up this is you know

242
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,019
people in the marketplace who are

243
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,550
building a marketplace know what

244
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,589
liquidity means it means demand and

245
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:32,610
supply go up together if they don't you

246
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:34,860
have a marketplace in our world as

247
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,050
liquidity goes up the quality of the

248
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,269
experience goes up and it dramatically

249
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,189
right so our average pickup times in San

250
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,019
Francisco are two minutes and 45 seconds

251
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:44,730
when we first started in New York we're

252
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,499
like 12 minute average pickup times and

253
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,389
let me tell you you don't want to be

254
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:51,050
delivering 12 minute pickup times to New

255
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:53,819
Yorkers they will kick your ass

256
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,170
so as it gets better now we're right

257
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,220
around five minutes in New York and

258
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,540
that's kind of when they lose their

259
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:03,720
minds as more people use it you go from

260
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,699
the core user base to bigger the

261
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,379
engagement actually gets deeper the

262
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:12,629
number of rides per Rider per month

263
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:15,660
actually go up as we expand as a cool

264
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,429
cohort graph but who cares all right the

265
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,470
bottom line is that 50% of the people

266
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:23,249
who've ever used still use and we've

267
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,679
seen that from the beginning this is an

268
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:28,110
interesting one this is San Francisco

269
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,329
indexed revenue so we're getting there's

270
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,370
lots of town cars in San Francisco right

271
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:35,399
the number of town cars that they were

272
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:40,019
in San Francisco before we got there was

273
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:43,649
600 there are now more cars dedicated to

274
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:46,139
Eber then there were town cars in San

275
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,129
Francisco when we got there and so

276
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,449
you're like well this thing is going to

277
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,670
slow down this train is going to slow

278
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:54,089
down at some point we indexed San

279
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,709
Francisco revenue from last year July

280
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,019
1st through the end of the year and

281
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,179
looked at this year July 1st to where we

282
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,759
are now and it's tracking almost

283
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,050
identical so it's not slowing down

284
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,139
anytime soon and when you're talking

285
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,540
about for a particular city 20 percent

286
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,429
month-over-month it growth that's that's

287
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,329
really big growth especially when you're

288
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:17,069
when the the numbers are getting big so

289
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,620
on the operations side I think a lot of

290
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,040
us are techies you know I'm an engineer

291
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,949
by

292
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,100
meaning we know what product managers

293
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,600
are we know what that means but when

294
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,519
you're on the ground when your

295
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,459
technology touches people and it touches

296
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,430
cities what you have to do is have

297
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,930
process managers process managers are

298
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,199
similar product managers they manage the

299
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:43,860
process that people do versus machines

300
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:46,050
and the roadmap for product has to

301
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,490
dovetail with the roadmap for process

302
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,949
because anytime we change anything that

303
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,230
happens in a car that's got to change

304
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,160
the tech and vice versa so there's

305
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,290
really interesting Road mapping

306
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,610
processes that we go through come on

307
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,880
this is supposed to be a picture of

308
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,500
Europe we're rolling out very big in

309
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,660
Europe right now so getting the

310
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,399
operational expertise and I think this

311
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,589
just isn't talked a lot about in

312
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,670
startups is the operation side of the

313
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,970
business I think a lot of e-commerce

314
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,980
companies see that we see it on a very

315
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,990
deep level because of you know the

316
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,000
rubber is actually meeting the road but

317
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,079
getting teams ready to roll out in

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,430
Europe is something we've been spending

319
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,389
time where in Paris in London right now

320
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,339
like I said we're going to be an

321
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,260
Amsterdam very soon and there's a whole

322
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,610
host of other cities that were that are

323
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,680
lined up in Europe and that's going to

324
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,230
be a big push end of this year all the

325
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,000
way into the first half of next year we

326
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,769
have somebody in Asia ready to go and

327
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,240
Sydney's sort of our first city in Asia

328
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:49,560
pack and I can't wait to go to the

329
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,180
launch party okay all right so quality

330
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,220
and choice it was really interesting

331
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,290
right we we had this high-end thing it's

332
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,380
cost about 50 percent more than a cab

333
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,420
and everybody said oh that's high-end

334
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,139
and everybody goes wow I'm going to do a

335
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,790
low-cost uber there's like a few

336
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:10,380
companies out there I can't remember

337
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,779
their names that decide they're going to

338
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,029
be a low-cost - when they clone our app

339
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,579
you know they flatter us by basically

340
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:21,870
stealing all the pixels and copying them

341
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:24,540
over to their app uber fYI Buber is

342
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,339
going to be a low-cost uber but it's

343
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,410
about quality and choice and what we see

344
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,779
when we lo when we roll out a low-cost

345
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,910
option what we see is that

346
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,699
actually engagement gets deeper because

347
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,980
people have choice they don't have to

348
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:40,839
always get the expensive thing so they

349
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,459
start using it more often people who

350
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,230
maybe wouldn't start with the black card

351
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:47,110
products start with taxi or what we call

352
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,190
uber X and then it's date night and they

353
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,019
want to prove you know they want to

354
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,480
impress their lady or they just need a

355
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,990
comfortable ride and it it goes from

356
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,959
there so this was a little choice of

357
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,529
beautiful thing let's keep moving

358
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:05,230
taxi we did in Chicago in April we now

359
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:08,110
have a few cities we're in Boston

360
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:12,160
Toronto Chicago San Francisco we were in

361
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,220
New York over not anymore don't get me

362
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,220
started

363
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,870
fair enough we'll get to that at the end

364
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:23,680
we did uberx which is sort of like a

365
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,290
low-end uber where and we did this in

366
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,750
July in San Francisco in New York and

367
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,449
that's where it's basically 30% cheaper

368
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,100
all hybrid fleet at least in SF where

369
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:35,170
we're starting to diversify a little bit

370
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:40,149
out of hybrids because we can't get the

371
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:42,040
partners to buy cars fast enough but the

372
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,449
thing is is you push a button and a car

373
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,480
appears in five minutes and that feels

374
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:49,269
magical but how you make that happen is

375
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,160
actually very complex so we have a math

376
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:52,449
department here there I like to tell

377
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,850
them I say look guys you're in charge of

378
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:57,610
our margins right because they need to

379
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,949
get the pickup times really low but the

380
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,199
utilization really high how do you do

381
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:04,000
that right well you do that through a

382
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:07,480
lot of math but let's start with our

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,060
math department okay that's not my math

384
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,010
department but we have two nuclear

385
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:16,149
physicists on staff a computational

386
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,130
neuroscientist a machine learning expert

387
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,199
and a few other guys there they're

388
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:24,040
killing it and some of the things they

389
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:26,230
do they do demand prediction congestion

390
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,660
prediction supply matching supply

391
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:33,399
positioning smart dispatch algorithms

392
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:37,029
dynamic pricing Friday and Saturday

393
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:40,180
night are special nights we sometimes

394
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,709
get really big waves of demand that you

395
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,089
can't really get enough cars to do

396
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,630
anything about so you have a marketplace

397
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,030
oriented sort of dynamic

398
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:51,500
pricing element that clears the market

399
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:53,870
it gets more cars on the road and in

400
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,640
sort of lassos in sort of uncontrollable

401
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,170
demand you can't see these pictures

402
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,270
really well because of the lights but

403
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,160
they're pretty these are some heat maps

404
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,710
of cities this is DC right here but you

405
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,120
you guys probably can't see it this is

406
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,120
Manhattan can't you tell

407
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:13,550
anyways these are useless I'll just keep

408
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:15,470
going okay all right this right here is

409
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,050
what drivers see this is our supply

410
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:22,280
positioning so in our company when mass

411
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:24,350
goes operational that becomes how am i

412
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,610
doing on time by the way I have no

413
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:30,110
timing here eight minutes left all right

414
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,500
hey minutes left all right this is going

415
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,090
to suck all right all right so supply

416
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,070
positioning right we have a heat map of

417
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,510
demand but I can basically we're

418
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,570
predicting demand twenty minutes ahead

419
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,880
of time the problem is is that if I gave

420
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,460
the heat map to drivers right they'll

421
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,050
all go to the same spot and then that'll

422
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,390
be bad for a lot of people who aren't in

423
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,100
that hot spot so we do is we say here's

424
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,050
the heat map of demand or prediction for

425
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,360
20 minutes ahead time but where is the

426
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,370
supply right now that's anti heat that

427
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,560
sucks the heat out of the map what's

428
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,870
left over is residual heat under serve

429
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,400
demand and we do that on a neighborhood

430
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,280
by neighborhood basis will ultimately go

431
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,500
continuous on it the math is very tricky

432
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,540
and complex and computationally

433
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,190
intensive but that gives you a sense of

434
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,690
some of the things we do that's in-car

435
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,190
you don't see it because once you get in

436
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,640
the car he's on trip and he doesn't see

437
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,400
that map anymore dynamic pricing I

438
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,050
talked a little bit about that already

439
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,070
we have one of our nuclear physicists

440
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,270
guys is a big San Francisco Giants fan

441
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,830
clearly we have to look at events in the

442
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,830
city because that affects the man in a

443
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,960
big way when the Giants play of course

444
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,460
demand is huge when the Giants win it's

445
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,310
much huger than when they lose as people

446
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,600
want to go out in style you know they

447
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,830
want to go the bars they're just feeling

448
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,230
good actually what's interesting is in

449
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,850
Boston when they lose when the Red Sox

450
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,850
lose we actually have bigger demand

451
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,910
no joke here's what's really interesting

452
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,830
it's not enough to make money yet I just

453
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,870
gave away the punchline but basically

454
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,120
that huge uptick in demand one that when

455
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,710
a giant San Francisco Giants win starts

456
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,710
about three hours before the game begins

457
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,290
uber Vegas is going to take on a whole

458
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:18,180
new meaning okay so I'm going to really

459
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,800
speed through here and I've sucked

460
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,650
because there's so much cool regulatory

461
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,240
stuff I could have talked about but

462
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,040
giving riders high fives

463
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,270
look transportations and thought of as a

464
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,460
boring space it's boring well until you

465
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,740
push a button a car magically appears

466
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,260
but we basically have lots of people who

467
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,700
love us and how do we get them to tell

468
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,600
that story over and over again give them

469
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,920
an excuse to tell the uber story so we

470
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,490
do a lot of creative things I think a

471
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,290
lot of you guys have seen that but look

472
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,910
Valentine's Day we distribute tens of

473
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,650
thousands of roses to thousands of

474
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,450
drivers every girl who got in a car

475
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:59,930
after 4 p.m. was handed a rose by the

476
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,930
driver that's a strong move fellas

477
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:12,809
I call it I call this scaling romance

478
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:15,120
okay on Presidents Day in DC we did what

479
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:19,169
we call an uber Kade okay

480
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,659
Escalade Town Car Escalade American

481
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:23,610
flags all the way down one out of every

482
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:33,870
20 people that push the button and uber

483
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:36,150
Kade rolls up the druk the driver the

484
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,400
driver has an earpiece that makes them

485
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,809
look like Secret Service and as you're

486
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,970
driving through town kids are like

487
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:48,390
waving they're like knocking on the

488
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:50,309
window we did something in we did

489
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,230
something in South by Southwest

490
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:54,090
we got pedicabs because you don't do a

491
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,090
town car in South white that's just

492
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:00,059
douchey like don't do that but a pedicab

493
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,860
let's do this right so we did that

494
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,120
that's cool 100 pedicabs you push a

495
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,669
button pedicab takes you wherever you

496
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,220
want to go but we took ten of those

497
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:11,159
petty cabs and we outfitted them with

498
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:14,039
these containers that could hold Texas

499
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,870
barbecue so we did on demand Texas

500
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:20,100
barbecue you push the button and a cow

501
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:22,770
would come to you on the map we did ice

502
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,230
cream in July and every time we roll out

503
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:28,080
a city we do what's called rider zero

504
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,830
the first person to get in an uber when

505
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,929
we soft-launched

506
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,020
it used to be an organic thing that just

507
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,340
happened and then the my city team

508
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,230
started getting excited about it this is

509
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,070
Edward Norton taking the first we were

510
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:44,520
in Los Angeles to go surfing so we give

511
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:47,520
riders high-fives but we give drivers

512
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,590
hugs and that's because look the riders

513
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,360
you know they date night goes well they

514
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,350
get to their business meeting on time or

515
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,770
they're not stranded a certain part of

516
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,360
town but for a driver who's scrapping

517
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,159
who maybe has a few hours in the morning

518
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,230
and one or two hours in the evening or

519
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,230
in the afternoon booked filling out that

520
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,350
time with a consistent revenue stream

521
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,750
helps him make ends meet and so you go

522
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,210
from just barely making ends meet to

523
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,649
really making a living and then

524
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,380
investing in your business we have

525
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:18,760
drivers who

526
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,560
from one car to 15 each of those cars

527
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,690
grossing more than a hundred grand a

528
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,590
year so these guys are living their

529
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,200
American dream

530
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,000
this is riad he actually was hustling

531
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,010
one of our engineers early on our

532
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,650
engineers were getting unlimited uber

533
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,750
he's like I got it were cool but why

534
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,370
don't you come join you bur he did he's

535
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,750
the highest performing driver on the

536
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,770
system he makes twenty or thirty percent

537
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,210
more per hour

538
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,120
I was productive driver on the system

539
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,680
than all the other drivers he also the

540
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,380
highest rated driver we still haven't

541
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,630
figured out how he does what he does he

542
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,660
now has five cars on the system he

543
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,320
recently had his firstborn son named his

544
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,150
son after our engineer that's not funny

545
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,440
like that's for real all right

546
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:05,590
this is Hani he's a comedian been in the

547
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,000
city for about 25 years he or he thinks

548
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,800
of himself as a comedian every time I

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,550
get in the car he tells me used to be a

550
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,230
Chippendales dancer this is Steve Aziz

551

and guys just somebody signal when I'm

552
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,470
running out of time I have no idea I'll

553
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,100
go over and spend an hour up here if you

554
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,190
let me two minutes okay all right Steve

555
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,730
Aziz has 15 or sorry 20 cars on the

556
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,190
system

557
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,260
he started with one he's got five kids

558
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:34,600
told me out of six going and six on the

559
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:36,700
way that's funny I said Steve six kids

560
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,450
you're crazy what are you doing dude

561
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,400
that's nuts

562
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,200
you got a business to run he's like I

563
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,070
got I got to keep the uber that we were

564
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,450
FLE growing

565
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:48,360
his son there doesn't look too happy to

566
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,060
be part of the uber fleet well I could

567
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,290
talk about regulation I'd spend a couple

568
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,820
minutes the bottom line is and I can't

569
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,730
go through a bunch of slides because I

570
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,200
really don't have the time well I don't

571
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,390
know let's just go until somebody stop

572
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,760
saying this is a New York City medallion

573
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,910
that's the license to basically own and

574
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,740
operate a single taxi in New York the

575
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,360
number of taxis or medallions in New

576
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,110
York it's the blue bar there the dark

577
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,390
blue it's basically been flat since 1946

578
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,870
the same number of taxis that were in

579
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,170
the city in 1946 is the same number of

580
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,880
taxis that are out there today that

581
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:30,090
value of that Medina is worth about a

582
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,370
million dollars a pop there are 13,000

583
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,680
medallions in the city of New York so

584
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:38,850
you have 13 billion dollars directed at

585
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,860
keeping uber from being successful DC we

586
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,110
had a really interesting situation

587
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,040
we went there by the way we were as far

588
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,340
as we could tell

589
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,840
we were totally legal White Glove legal

590
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,650
nicest laws in the country in terms of

591
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:56,000
sedans in DC but DC taxi commissioner

592
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,870
goes out there and says ubers not legal

593
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,420
because they charge by time and distance

594
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,330
and let's just say that was real why is

595
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:07,200
charging by distance evil I don't

596
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,190
understand I don't get it but he said

597
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,360
look you're charging my time and

598
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,210
distance you're not allowed well we

599
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,710
looked at the law law says sedan a for

600
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,270
hire vehicle designed to carry fewer

601
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,220
than six passengers which charges with a

602
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,110
service on the basis of time and mileage

603
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,360
like what are you talking about is going

604
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,000
in public forms Washington Post etc we

605
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,670
go the Attorney General in the District

606
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,670
of Columbia and that's what he tells us

607
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:36,390
so when you read about the crazy stuff

608
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,649
we're doing in the cities and I've got

609
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,640
to close this down because I'm - that

610
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:40,860
somebody's going to have the hook and

611
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,720
they're going to take me off here but

612
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,710
when you read about the crazy stuff that

613
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,740
we're doing in the cities know that it

614
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,539
is corrupt out there know that we are

615
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,110
highly highly disruptive in what you

616
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:57,179
read in the papers isn't always true and

617
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:00,029
the bottom line is that in order to be

618
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,190
in this business in order to be this

619
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:05,279
disruptive to what's going on you have

620
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:08,519
to have you have to be willing to to

621
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,490
fight and you have to not be it you

622
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,289
can't be shy so that gives you a little

623
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,580
bit about it basically they try to put a

624
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,470
floor on our prices I'll leave it at

625
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,649
this one this last one here they put a

626
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:21,659
floor on our prices try to pass what

627
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:25,019
they call the uber amendment make our

628
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,940
prices five times out of a taxi they

629
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:31,350
rolled the amendment out July 10th

630
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:35,159
there's a Monday at a July 9th the vote

631
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,510
on the bill is the tenth sorry they put

632
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,820
the bill out on the night that was a

633
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,620
Monday at 4:00 p.m. to vote on at 11:00

634
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,450
a.m. the next day 18 hours most of which

635
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,429
are going to be sleeping I wrote an

636
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,070
email to our consumers letting know that

637
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:48,630
they were about to do this and by the

638
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,299
way the rationale was to ensure that

639
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,130
basically we don't compete if a CEO of a

640
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,740
company told said something like this

641
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,360
they'd be in jail but if you corrupt

642
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,149
your politicians and then push those

643
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,919
laws down it's totally legal anyways we

644
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:04,559
did something called life liberty and

645
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,159
the pursuit of Urbanus uber DC love is a

646
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,570
hashtag 18 hours later we had 50,000

647
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,419
original emails these weren't robo

648
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,760
emails that went to City Council people

649
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,669
telling them not to vote for it

650
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:23,269
37,000 tweets 104 million social media

651
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:23,269
impressions and we won and

652
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,049
as you might imagine there wasn't a lot

653
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,929
of sleep during that time but it was so

654
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:38,299
short it maybe didn't matter so anyways

655
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:41,240
guys I think the bottom line I've got so

656
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:43,220
much stuff Vegas by the way gambling and

657
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,419
prostitution illegal in Vegas but Hoover

658
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:50,600
is not I got so much stuff I probably

659
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:52,100
have to end this I'll just end with just

660
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,450
a couple more slides here guys and I'm

661
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,789
sorry about this

662
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,409
look technology is wiring up the core

663
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,240
services in city life right

664
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:01,250
Airbnb us a bunch of other companies

665
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,870
they're changing not just tech not just

666
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,809
your twitter app they're changing how

667
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,399
you live but that change used to happen

668
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,669
over decades it's not happening over

669
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:16,159
months quality of life is not red it's

670
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:17,570
not blue it's just people right cities

671
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,130
that resist are going to feel backwards

672
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,230
and their cities were not in they feel

673
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,149
backwards all right a lot of our

674
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,520
customers who are used to this go to

675
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:26,990
other cities it doesn't work so I asked

676
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,880
the mayor's what are you protecting who

677
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,370
are you protecting now and realize they

678
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,020
just don't even realize that they're

679
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,190
protecting they think the taxi industry

680
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,880
they think drivers know you're actually

681
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,470
screwing over drivers so cities need

682
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,850
transportation alternatives but they

683
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,789
need modern accountable convenient

684
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,220
stylish and efficient ones we're out

685
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:47,510
there in a city near you guys and look I

686
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,740
