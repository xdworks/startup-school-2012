1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:09,570
welcome everybody I'm bigger yeah yeah

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:11,219
here you guys are too okay so um these

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,809
are the questions that I was curious

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,549
about um and I think they'll be the

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,710
questions you guys are curious about too

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,150
I'm gonna ask a lot about the very early

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,010
days of Facebook home we were just

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,900
talking about them in the back it was

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,960
fascinating wish you could have heard it

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,779
oh oh we'll do our best to try and

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,970
reproduce it um so here's a question

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,239
that might be a little bit difficult um

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,430
how long before 2004 could something

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,960
like Facebook have succeeded like what

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,790
was the last thing that was needed to

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,870
fall into place could someone have done

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,510
it in 1995 or 2000 yeah no it's an

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,680
interesting question um there were

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,750
certain elements that we certainly

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,390
bootstrapped off of and kind of used to

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,309
hack early identity right so one of the

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,960
things that that people don't think

23
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,699
about that often today is early on we

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,680
wanted to establish this culture of real

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,000
identity on the service and you know

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,769
there weren't really any other online

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,080
services or communities where people

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,240
were openly their their real self before

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,650
that and one of the ways that we kind of

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,580
determined that someone was really who

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,950
they said they were and their

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,869
credentials were real where everyone had

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,340
school email addresses and I don't know

34
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,320
how much before 2004 assume you know

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,000
probably around 2000 all schools started

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,799
issuing email addresses but that was

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,150
really this critical thing that made it

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,220
so that we could get servers this

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,049
counterintuitive thing that um not many

40
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,060
other services were using so school

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,640
email addresses were the original source

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,079
of identity well that's how he knew what

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,030
school you were in right and then you

44
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,350
weren't just a sock puppet because you

45
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,270
can't just get the school to keep yeah

46
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,979
exactly yeah meal address yeah yeah yeah

47
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,450
so it also admits that people couldn't

48
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,310
sign up for fake accounts right right

49
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,259
people typically only have one school

50
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,390
account so having being able to

51
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,220
bootstrap off of that was this really

52
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,990
nice early thing that that helped us

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,420
establish this culture of real identity

54
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,100
and once we got to a few million people

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,990
or 10 million people where that culture

56
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,310
was established it was able to bootstrap

57
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,719
into something that was much bigger that

58
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,490
kept most of that culture even though

59
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,710
now obviously most people in the world

60
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,780
don't have emails that are issued by

61
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,280
some institution that vouch this or

62
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,340
their identity now people log in through

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,020
Facebook

64
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,660
now you are the source of high density

65
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,760
well you know it comes around yeah but

66
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,349
you know but but to your question about

67
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,790
when would it have been possible you

68
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,120
know one of the big trends that we see

69
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,310
is that the amount that any individual

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,470
shares in a given year seems to be

71
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,050
growing of this exponentially increasing

72
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,640
rate right Berg's law yeah I don't call

73
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,340
it that but but other people do you

74
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,569
heard in your first but um you know I I

75
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,370
mean it is this kind of social

76
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,780
networking version of Moore's law and

77
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,390
it's interesting and you know what that

78
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,340
suggests to me is you know if we expect

79
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,160
that this rate is going to double every

80
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,980
year then you know look out 10 years to

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,540
to the 10th is 1024 right so 10 years

82
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,130
from now people will be sharing about a

83
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,130
thousand times as many things

84
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,879
you know better adhesion next year

85
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,190
I feel like everything will be cool

86
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,720
anyway I just have a good I have a good

87
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,489
feeling about today I don't think that's

88
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,810
a bad omen no that's wonderful

89
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,250
um Sonia so I think the question is not

90
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,500
would Facebook have not been possible

91
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,849
before 2004 it would have been in some

92
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,819
capacity but people would have shared

93
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,560
less and if you fast forward five years

94
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,879
there's going to be a version of there

95
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,099
gonna be all these social services that

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,110
people are using to share way more and I

97
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,879
think that anyone here could be can kind

98
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,900
of think about you know K ten years from

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
now people are gonna be sharing a

100
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,620
thousand times as much stuff a day if

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,000
this if this trend continues what's what

102
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,829
things are gonna have to exist in the

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,090
world what kind of services are gonna

104
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:43,900
have to exist in order for that to be

105
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,220
possible Instagram for toilets um that's

106
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,810
the final frontier

107
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,190
I mean Instagram is killing it I mean

108
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:53,110
they're they're doing really well so

109
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:55,390
that's a good frontier all right when

110
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,730
you first launched in the very beginning

111
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,200
the features were sort of profile with

112
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,480
like a profile photo and your name and

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,060
who you are and also you included things

114
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,160
like what house you lived in what dorm

115
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,870
you lived in um and what courses you

116
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,280
were taking do you think it would have

117
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,010
worked without that would it have been

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,660
enough just to have profiles you know

119
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,730
it's a really interesting question and

120
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,410
we certainly since then have evolved and

121
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,840
wanted to make a more general service so

122
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,599
we've dropped some of those things but I

123
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,320
remember um there's this early debate

124
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:28,060
that Dustin and I had where we had to do

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,820
some manual work for every school that

126
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,380
we we're earliest Facebook ad and in

127
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,400
order to do that we basically went

128
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,990
through and we parsed the course

129
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,660
catalogs of the schools to make sure the

130
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,039
data was clean and um and I remember

131
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,650
having this debate where Dustin was like

132
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,180
we could just expend so much faster or

133
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,400
it would just be easier I mean we were

134
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,979
bound by server capacity but it would be

135
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,690
easier to launch new schools if we

136
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:51,700
didn't have to have course catalogs for

137
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,090
each school and we just had this really

138
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,830
long debate about what quality meant for

139
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,960
us and the community that we wanted to

140
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,389
establish and in the culture of it and

141
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,340
you know in retrospect you know maybe

142
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,780
you wouldn't have had a huge difference

143
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,280
on how things played out but it

144
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,800
definitely kind of set this tone where

145
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,349
there's a lot of kind of clean data on

146
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,159
Facebook you can rely on it it feels

147
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:15,110
like a college specific thing yeah

148
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,610
which was valuable early on for setting

149
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,739
the culture even though obviously since

150
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,659
then we've grown beyond that and you

151
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,739
know I think you guys in the projects

152
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:23,239
that you work on you're gonna have a lot

153
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,580
of similar questions right I mean

154
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,289
there's the the famous 80/20 rule where

155
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,459
you know you get 80% of the benefit by

156
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:33,169
doing 20% of the work but you can't just

157
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,699
80/20 everything right I mean there have

158
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,229
to be certain things that you just are

159
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,459
the best at right and that you go way

160
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,409
further than anyone else had to

161
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,550
establish this kind of quality bar and

162
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,959
have your product be the best thing

163
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,759
that's out there so you know whether we

164
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,229
had to do that one or had to do

165
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,399
something we had to do I think enough of

166
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,689
those things or else we just wouldn't

167
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,069
been the best service out there do you

168
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,110
remember when you got rid of courses

169
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:54,199
when did you stop part including course

170
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,779
Kaizen probably when we expanded beyond

171
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,849
colleges really so you kept doing

172
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,309
courses yeah all through girls was like

173
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:04,039
hundreds of colleges um I think we

174
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:05,449
eventually figured out a way that just

175
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,519
crowd-sourced and made it a bit easier

176
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,079
once we had enough data that we could

177
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,509
extrapolate from the colleges that we

178
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,649
had in place but we did it for probably

179
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:16,939
way longer than was rational hmm

180
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:19,569
do you do you remember how much your

181
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:22,399
first server cost you said oh yeah $85

182
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,110
$85 yeah and I remember that because

183
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,969
that was the gating factor for us

184
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,379
launching new schools I I mean we had

185
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,509
this philosophy from the very beginning

186
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,679
that we didn't want to be this project

187
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,999
it wasn't even a company at the very

188
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:33,289
beginning but we didn't want to be

189
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,639
burning a lot of money right we weren't

190
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,019
planning on raising a lot of money we

191
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,729
didn't want to be one of these things

192
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,079
that raised a bunch of money and you

193
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,369
know was losing a bunch of money and

194
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,869
then decided that we'd somehow pull it

195
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:46,129
through at the end and um so you know so

196
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:48,099
$85 for the first server put ads on the

197
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,149
site and the ads at the beginning where

198
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,860
we just were running some kind of ad

199
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:57,949
network and you murder what the first ad

200
00:06:51,860 --> 00:07:01,399
was um no I don't I don't how do I get

201
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:03,319
ads um this was Eduardo's job Verizon

202
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,209
was I mean he was your ad sales he yeah

203
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,619
he basically like he was responsible for

204
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,039
making sure that we had enough money to

205
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:11,269
keep things running in the beginning and

206
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,969
you know basically I mean so it was the

207
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:16,009
server was $85 and you know Dustin and I

208
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:17,059
basically worked on kind of efficiency

209
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,599
and making sure that we can fit more

210
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:22,279
schools onto each server and and Eduardo

211
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,630
worked on selling more ads or making a

212
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,100
deals that we can get

213
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,180
ad network so that way we can we can

214
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,460
make more money then whenever we had

215
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,320
more money we rented another $85 a month

216
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,590
server and we kind of went from there

217
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,700
and some interesting way of soo never

218
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,680
spent money you didn't have in the

219
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,360
beginning not in the beginning no and

220
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,670
then I mean even why was the constraint

221
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,380
on your growth rate how many new $85 is

222
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,630
you could get yeah and I mean it was

223
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,160
actually good because I mean you know

224
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,890
sometimes it's really nice to have the

225
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,660
time to get your product to be awesome

226
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,890
and deal with scaling problems and one

227
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,740
of the things that was interesting was

228
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,000
um you know at the time I don't know how

229
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,590
many people remember this but I mean

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,360
Friendster was the service that had

231
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,710
massive scaling problems yeah you know

232
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,120
the idea was they were they grew quickly

233
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,160
and it was really hard for them to scale

234
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,320
and you know the fact that we could kind

235
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,970
of go college by college and and kind of

236
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,530
optimize the service and make it more

237
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,600
efficient and offer new features but

238
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,280
make sure that they worked I think was

239
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,330
really key I mean we're you're talking

240
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,920
about people who never built a company

241
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,590
before we never built any large-scale

242
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,780
software or anything so having the

243
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,670
period where we could just bake it and

244
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,050
you know people these days like to talk

245
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,030
about how these services grow super

246
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,610
quickly then Facebook did grow quickly

247
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,050
but I think it took a year for us to get

248
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,960
a million users and we thought that that

249
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,870
was incredibly fast but and and I think

250
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,070
it is but it wasn't as quick as a lot of

251
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,229
things grow today and I think actually

252
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,400
having that time to bake it was really

253
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,150
valuable for and there were like two

254
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,230
thousand users at Harvard that's 500x in

255
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,680
a year that's pretty fast

256
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,270
well they're I think around 4,000 or

257
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,620
5,000 undergrads at Harvard I remember

258
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,570
reading you got half of them I mean

259
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,860
presumably well no there was two-thirds

260
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,150
or three-quarters or something in the

261
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,940
first two weeks so I mean the thing that

262
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,400
we found was that basically we opened it

263
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,320
up at a school and and within you know a

264
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,640
couple of weeks then the vast majority

265
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,940
of students would it would be on the

266
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,380
surface

267
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,980
was there a school ever that you opened

268
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,910
it and it didn't work it didn't stick um

269
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,590
some schools took longer than others

270
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,840
depending on the size of the school so

271
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,270
what we basically did was so I launched

272
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,190
it at Harvard first because I wanted it

273
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,750
right haven't I built it for myself

274
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,250
I like I really want to be able to use

275
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,620
the service and you know this is one of

276
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,880
the ironies is I started building

277
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,140
Facebook because I wanted to use it in

278
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,030
college and then I immediately left

279
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,340
college so I didn't really get to do

280
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,650
that but um just expand it to everybody

281
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,330
else outside no yeah so it worked out

282
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,640
but

283
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,830
you know so then after Harvard all these

284
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,120
schools started well a lot of students

285
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,019
from other schools started writing to us

286
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,029
and asking for us to expand and we

287
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:49,459
weren't looking to start a company right

288
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,990
and I figured that eventually something

289
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,510
like this would would exist at large

290
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,100
scale but you know one of the one of the

291
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,980
interesting juxtapositions that was

292
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,040
going on at the time was I remember

293
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,690
distinctly I had this one friend who I

294
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,800
went and got pizza with almost every

295
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,560
night we did all our computer science

296
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,230
problem sets together at Harvard and at

297
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,269
the time I remember talking to him about

298
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,399
how I was working on this Facebook thing

299
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,170
and I thought it would be cool for

300
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,790
Harvard and I really was excited about

301
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,890
it because I wanted to use it but at the

302
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,750
same time how I thought that over time

303
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,550
someone would definitely go build this

304
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,690
version of this for the world but it

305
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,640
wasn't gonna be us it was going to be

306
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,350
you know Microsoft or you know someone

307
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,399
who built the software for hundreds of

308
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,570
millions of people it's like who were we

309
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,910
word college student sorry we're not

310
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,560
qualified in any way to build this and I

311
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,690
think a lot of my take away from that

312
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,920
was that we just kind of cared more than

313
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,290
those other companies about making it

314
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,430
exist so anyhow but back to your it back

315
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,370
to your kind of question and off that

316
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,230
tangent the first set of schools that we

317
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,970
launched out after Harvard were schools

318
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,170
that had other kind of school specific

319
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,320
social network so I think it was

320
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,020
Stanford had something Columbia had

321
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,520
something and I think Yale had something

322
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,230
so why would you choose ones that had

323
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,260
school specific social network because I

324
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,430
wanted to editors well I wanted to go to

325
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,320
the schools I thought would be the

326
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,000
hardest for us to succeed at because I

327
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,620
knew that if we had a product that was

328
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,970
better than everything else that other

329
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,100
students were making at other colleges

330
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,690
then it would be worth investing in and

331
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,579
putting putting time into but I didn't

332
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,930
want to just kind of like get into a

333
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,459
project where they would end up being

334
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,839
this huge legacy of maintaining it if

335
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,130
ultimately they were just going to be

336
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,510
different things that were as good as it

337
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,730
so and we thought that this was going to

338
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,680
be good and you know we launched it at

339
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,760
it was Yale Stanford Columbia and and

340
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,490
yeah I mean pretty quickly I think it

341
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,560
just so you felt probably that you could

342
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,970
have just gone to some random school and

343
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,010
it would have succeeded you chose those

344
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,560
because they had nascent competitors

345
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,600
yeah I mean I think what we saw at those

346
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,339
schools was people wanted to use

347
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,460
something like this right so we just

348
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:47,350
wanted to make sure that what we had was

349
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,240
like way better than anything else that

350
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,540
was out there worth you know putting

351
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,940
time into do you think I know I read in

352
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,830
the crimson article about when you first

353
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,200
launched hundreds of people sign up for

354
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,990
new hundreds hundreds sign up for new

355
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,150
Facebook website that is not the onion

356
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,780
that is the crimson all sometimes hard

357
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:11,860
to distinguish um Harvard students huh

358
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,450
um okay so uh do you think though they

359
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,340
said in this article that Harvard the

360
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,200
Harvard Computer Services people were

361
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,790
working on at university wide Facebook

362
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,840
their problem was to like they couldn't

363
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,720
figure out how to restrict information

364
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,520
enough right um do you think if that had

365
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,140
already existed if you had been a couple

366
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
years younger and he would come to

367
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,540
Harvard and this already existed do you

368
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,850
think you would have ever started

369
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,200
Facebook I don't know I mean there's

370
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,000
this trend that I was talking about

371
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,620
before where each year people share more

372
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,740
and more right so I think that you can

373
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,360
kind of math out at any given point and

374
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,220
I think you can look at the the internet

375
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,840
and say okay there's enough sharing to

376
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,510
support certain products right so

377
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Wikipedia came really before Facebook

378
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,590
because there was a smaller amount of

379
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,900
sharing could support information about

380
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,540
all the public entities and railed right

381
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,250
but in order to have enough sharing to

382
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,920
support some basic information so you

383
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,290
can look up anyone and find some

384
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,640
interesting stuff about them then that

385
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,730
that required more sharing so we had to

386
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,960
be further along this curve and you know

387
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,010
made a couple years earlier someone

388
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,690
might have been able to do something

389
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,130
that was more basic but a couple years

390
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,390
later even a couple years from now

391
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,910
someone will be able to build something

392
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,170
that is just so much more encompassing

393
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,670
and allows people to learn so much more

394
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,620
about the people around them than what

395
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,110
is even built today so our kind of

396
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,280
continual mission and job is to keep on

397
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,810
building that next thing and I mean

398
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,700
that's what we live for at Facebook and

399
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,320
what excites us so even if Harvard even

400
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,150
if the university had built something

401
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,840
there would always you could have built

402
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,730
the next thing

403
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,800
yeah and it's obviously always hard to

404
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,780
tell exactly how things would have

405
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,010
played out but I mean one of the

406
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,780
interesting things about Facebook was it

407
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,460
wasn't just a picture and some basic

408
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,140
info and it pretty quickly gave people

409
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,330
the ability to share more stuff right

410
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,490
now and one of the early stories that I

411
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,350
think is pretty instructor for anyone

412
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,600
who's trying to build a startup is you

413
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,310
know we really listen to what our users

414
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,320
wanted right in listening means both

415
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,820
kind of qualitatively listening to the

416
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,640
words that they say

417
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,560
and quantitatively looking at the

418
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,380
behaviors that they take and you know at

419
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,940
the beginning we we had one profile

420
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,310
picture that you could have on your on

421
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,590
your profile that on what we observed

422
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,050
was there was this behavior where a lot

423
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,000
of people would everyday upload a new

424
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,770
profile picture and you know our

425
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,480
takeaway from this was that you know

426
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,860
people there was this very strong demand

427
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,990
to have a service where people could

428
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,420
share more photos and it actually wasn't

429
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,740
until we had the server capacity and the

430
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,420
engineering team bandwidth to actually

431
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,550
build a full photo sharing service but

432
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,140
that that's become obviously one of the

433
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,700
key parts of Facebook I think we're over

434
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,320
three or four hundred million photos

435
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,990
shared a day now someone it's pretty

436
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,370
crazy but you know obviously no Facebook

437
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,020
that that any university would have

438
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,340
built would have supported that right

439
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,660
and you know even just like that right

440
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,040
or it's kind of really nice right yeah

441
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,600
any incremental I mean they would have

442
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,890
just had whatever mug shot you have on

443
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,690
your your card right would have been

444
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,210
your picture so they would have chosen

445
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,980
the picture yeah you can keep which is

446
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,470
in the picture yeah I can totally see

447
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,480
how it would have been um do you

448
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,430
remember when you first showed up in

449
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,660
college what you plan to do afterwards

450
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,040
do you think you were gonna go to

451
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,810
graduate school or did you think you

452
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,690
were going to get a job when I first

453
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,850
went to college I actually was planning

454
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,550
on being a classics major I loved

455
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,380
classics and and and high school Latin

456
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,470
and Greek I just found it fascinating

457
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,150
and my sister actually did go on and do

458
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,440
that just now PhD student in classics

459
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,840
and we talked about this all the time it

460
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,460
just still fascinating to me when I was

461
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,720
in college I actually wasn't a computer

462
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,680
science major I was a psychology major I

463
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,880
didn't really get around to taking that

464
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,080
many classes because I left pretty

465
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,210
quickly and I actually ended up taking

466
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,880
more computer science classes than than

467
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:40,420
psychology classes but I was never you

468
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,490
know I don't know so you had no plan no

469
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,100
I mean you're gonna be a barista no I

470
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,080
probably would have um I probably would

471
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,420
have gotten an engineering job is my

472
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,460
sense and I you'd have gotten sucked in

473
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,290
deprogramming uh well I mean I like

474
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,240
programming and I really you know

475
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,100
growing up I always had a lot of respect

476
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,810
for for Microsoft and what they built

477
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,720
and a lot of people from Harvard go to

478
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,800
Microsoft and went to Microsoft and I

479
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,240
maybe I would have done that I don't

480
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,450
know it's it's really obviously hard to

481
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,300
say later I made this bet with my sister

482
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,940
Donna the

483
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:14,240
six PhD I was talking about before who

484
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,970
um I bet her when I was starting college

485
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,190
before she was that or she bet me that

486
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,990
she would finish college before me and

487
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,060
and I was like all right that's I'll

488
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,180
take that bad it's a good story

489
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,380
I don't know and um and then after after

490
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,120
when I dropped out I was talking to my

491
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,230
mom and she's like ya know I always knew

492
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,100
you would drop out of college I was

493
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:37,100
gonna thanks mom so they need I don't

494
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,930
know you know notice that you would zoom

495
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,860
out of the top or fall out of the bottom

496
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,240
I never asked me that do you think

497
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,150
your parents knew that you would always

498
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,830
like run your own show cuz you asked

499
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:52,910
them I think they'd probably say yes but

500
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,200
yeah I did you want to start startups no

501
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,300
and I mean I think that's actually a

502
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,550
really interesting part of this for me

503
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,530
is and I mean being in a place like this

504
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,480
we're obviously a lot of you guys are

505
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,910
thinking about starting these starting

506
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,100
companies and you know for me so much of

507
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,680
the lesson that that I I feel like I've

508
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,960
learned is I feel like it's really hard

509
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,670
to decide to start a company right you

510
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,440
know Facebook I didn't start it to start

511
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,880
a company I started it because I really

512
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,560
wanted this thing personally and I

513
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,120
believe that it should exist globally

514
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,860
although I wasn't quite sure that that

515
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,410
we would be able to play a role in doing

516
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,130
that and um it was mostly just through

517
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,870
kind of like wanting to build it and

518
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,010
having it be this hobby and getting

519
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,780
people around me excited that it

520
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,640
eventually kind of evolved into and got

521
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,350
the momentum to become a company but I

522
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,240
never really understood the psychology

523
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,010
of deciding that you want to start a

524
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,660
company before you understand what you

525
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,890
want to do and then I know that that's

526
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,690
not that that's different from your

527
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,130
philosophy on them no no believe me I

528
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,230
wish we would get more people who-who

529
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,730
where the company started them rather

530
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,700
than vice-versa none of the issues is

531
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,110
just it once you this gets back to the

532
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,120
question of why did we why did we first

533
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,180
open it at colleges that had competitors

534
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,820
I have this big fear I think of getting

535
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,530
locked into doing things that aren't

536
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,150
actually the most impactful things I'm

537
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,010
to me this is like the trait that

538
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,160
entrepreneurs have is they just have

539
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,870
this like laser-like ability to go find

540
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,330
where they can have the most impact and

541
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,440
you know when you take on a new project

542
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,180
especially if you hire people or start a

543
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
company you're doing that project and I

544
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,790
mean there are ways they're obviously

545
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,650
different ways that it can exit and all

546
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,330
that but I think having the

547
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,740
flexibility to explore a lot of

548
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,760
different things which you can do when

549
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,170
you're in college which is one of the

550
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,090
amazing things about being in college is

551
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,010
you can work on all these hobbies and

552
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,690
and encode a lot of stuff and try a lot

553
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,980
of different things it's this amazing

554
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,480
flexibility that I think most people

555
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,010
take for granted and once you decide

556
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,570
okay I'm going to start a company and

557
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,160
I'm gonna do it with someone else you

558
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,630
immediately now need to convince someone

559
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,460
else if you want to change your mind on

560
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,990
something and I think people really

561
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,350
undervalued the option value in

562
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,720
flexibility so as I stay in college um I

563
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,640
think explore what you want to do before

564
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,240
committing is really like the key thing

565
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,830
and keep yourself flexible and know I

566
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,540
think that that's yeah I agree

567
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,620
yeah but but I think in it you can

568
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,820
definitely do that within the framework

569
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,000
of a company but I think you have to be

570
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,730
wary about starting a company too

571
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,650
rigidly because you're gonna change what

572
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,150
you do I mean people talk about pivots

573
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,590
all the time as if it's like it didn't

574
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,840
didn't your thing didn't work so you

575
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,760
pivoted Facebook pivoted many times I

576
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,410
mean just that you know we kind of work

577
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,820
college and then we were not college and

578
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,470
then we were just a website and then we

579
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,870
were a platform right and um you're

580
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,490
gonna change what you do right and oh

581
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,690
you're a minister you have there's

582
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,610
another word for the kind of pivots

583
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,320
you're talking about expansions well it

584
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,460
that's not what people usually mean by

585
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:39,140
pivoting well you know high flexibility

586
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,060
yeah um I'm curious when you first

587
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,710
started like there's a difference

588
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,780
between making something where people

589
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,240
sign up and making something where

590
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,130
people keep coming back yeah right what

591
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,960
was it you were talking about the way

592
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,640
you measured people's behavior what was

593
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,170
the feature that kept people coming back

594
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,890
to Facebook over and over again once

595
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:59,660
they created their profile I mean I

596
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,540
think it really just gets down to what

597
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,610
makes humans human right I mean like

598
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,160
this comes back to the my studying

599
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:10,310
psychology and all that but I mean the

600
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,590
human brain is is kind of uniquely wired

601
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,330
to process things about people right

602
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,540
it's like when I see when I look out I

603
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,520
see faces I don't see you know chairs or

604
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,710
the room around people it's like we're

605
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,150
hardwired to think about people I mean

606
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,130
there are whole parts of you know the

607
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,320
visual cortex that just process the

608
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,880
slightest kind of micro movements of

609
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,950
your face to process emotion and this is

610
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,010
like what people are and what fascinates

611
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,630
them and it's how we

612
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,700
how we process the world actually I

613
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,040
heard the study in recently that I think

614
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,990
is interesting which is that most humans

615
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,490
if you if you take an MRI when they're

616
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,809
dreaming they dream about social

617
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,500
interactions and humans are the only

618
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:50,360
animal that does that so now okay but

619
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,679
there was no service online that I mean

620
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,179
it when I when I thought about the

621
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,650
internet before Facebook there were all

622
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,030
these things I thought Google and search

623
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,260
engines were amazing right you can type

624
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,490
in something and get access to any

625
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,960
information that you wanted but you

626
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,640
couldn't learn about the people around

627
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
you right and because most of that

628
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,400
information isn't public and just out

629
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,380
there ready to be indexed by by some

630
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,790
search engine so answer had to be a

631
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,049
service that gave people the power to

632
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,490
share the things that they wanted and

633
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,010
control it in the way that they wanted

634
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,440
and and Facebook did that and I think

635
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,549
that it's you know one one um definition

636
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,620
of technology that I think is

637
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,320
interesting is it extends some natural

638
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,940
human capacity right so glasses or

639
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,970
contacts extend your ability to see

640
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,790
right Steve Jobs once famously compared

641
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,370
a computer to being a bicycle for your

642
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,750
mind right and basically extending your

643
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,090
ability to think and I mean the word

644
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,140
computer is the Latin think together

645
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,720
right so it's like you're you're

646
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,360
thinking together the social network I

647
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,660
think extends people's very real social

648
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,440
capacity I mean you hear all these um

649
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,570
approximations I mean there's this

650
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,640
famous Dunbar's number humans have the

651
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,380
capacity to maintain empathetic

652
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,120
relationships with about a hundred fifty

653
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,919
people communities about a hundred fifty

654
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,510
people I think Facebook extends that

655
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,980
where you see evidence of that within

656
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,240
Facebook by the way do you see certain

657
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,640
things that stop at one hundred and

658
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,140
fifty um naturally when people sign up

659
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,570
the average amount of friends that they

660
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,549
get is around 150 but then over time it

661
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,890
can expand and you can keep in touch and

662
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:15,350
stay in touch with many more people so I

663
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,600
think it's like so given that I actually

664
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,370
think one of the lessons from that is I

665
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,080
do something that's fundamental right I

666
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,390
mean I think a lot of people in a lot of

667
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,570
the companies that I see are operating

668
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,620
on on small problems right and um it's

669
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,660
cool if you want to be an entrepreneur

670
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,730
and salva and what you're primarily

671
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,010
trying to do is build a company and then

672
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,179
solve some tangible problem but but I

673
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,980
think that the most interesting things

674
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:38,750
operate on these phenomena in the world

675
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,059
which are really just fundamental to how

676
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,679
humans or the world operate so what you

677
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,960
did was something that was fundamental

678
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:45,660
for a small market and then you just

679
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
expand them are

680
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,110
from beyond Harvard students to everyone

681
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,000
but Harvard students are sufficiently

682
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,550
like that well it was gross yeah it was

683
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,140
fundamental for me right it's like I

684
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:59,190
like I felt this need really acutely I

685
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,360
really wanted this right and so yeah and

686
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,320
then I think it's just I mean that's one

687
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,210
of the things that I think we were lucky

688
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,100
about in kind of the expansion of the

689
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,150
market was that it turned out that this

690
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,890
wasn't something that was just for

691
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,390
college students almost everyone in the

692
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,860
world has friends and family and want to

693
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,910
stay in touch with those people so it

694
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,850
ended up being a pretty ubiquitous

695
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,010
service in retrospect this is a bit of a

696
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,020
controversial question perhaps but in

697
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,300
retrospect do you think myspace had a

698
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,740
chance since once you started and you

699
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,630
got all the college students I mean the

700
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,640
college students are arguably like the

701
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,320
center of gravity socially right you own

702
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,180
all the college students it feels like

703
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,980
you know from the point you start

704
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,270
expanding out of Harvard my Space

705
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,560
Mountain might not have known it maybe

706
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,050
you didn't even know it but it seems

707
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,990
like in retrospect they were doomed you

708
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,780
know I don't I don't see it that way

709
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,460
actually I they could have won no it's

710
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,500
not about winning and losing it's about

711
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,280
doing something that's valuable right

712
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,500
and there are more than one more than

713
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,660
one social network not really many

714
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,850
I mean my view of the world is that

715
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,560
almost every product in category is

716
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,510
going to get transformed and reimagined

717
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,090
to be social so there were things that

718
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,100
myspace did that Facebook has never done

719
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,010
you know MySpace I think was it was a

720
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,810
much better service early on for meeting

721
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,580
new people read Facebook was never

722
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,200
primarily about meeting new people it

723
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,930
was about staying connected with with

724
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,430
the people that you knew and and kind of

725
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,710
mapping out the real relationships that

726
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:22,410
existed now I think part of the issue is

727
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,880
the sauce growing and they felt

728
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,680
threatened by that and tried to copy

729
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,330
what we were doing and that's like

730
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,640
you're never going to win that way right

731
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,730
it is I mean I think of all these

732
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,780
interesting social services and apps

733
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,950
that are getting built today I mean

734
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,200
think about all the new apps that you

735
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,580
guys install on your phones there are so

736
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,830
many interesting things and there are

737
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,780
eight out of the top ten iOS apps plug

738
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,820
into Facebook 50 percent of the top 400

739
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,940
apps plug into Facebook they're all kind

740
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,140
of socially integrated and in these ways

741
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,300
but companies that are getting started

742
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,840
now that are just trying to copy the

743
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,730
stuff that that the other companies are

744
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,720
doing just aren't aren't successful by

745
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,740
the way how we doing

746
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,960
is there anybody in charge of time 12:27

747
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,670
what time do we start few more minutes

748
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,620
all right if you will ask you a few more

749
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,300
questions um so you think do you think

750
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,890
myspace could have survived if they had

751
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,740
gone off into some marginal territory

752
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:17,130
like country marginally your somehow I

753
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,110
think that there is a real value in the

754
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,240
world people have a fundamental need I

755
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,070
think to stay connected with the people

756
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,930
they know and I think people have many

757
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,210
fundamental needs to meet new people and

758
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,830
expand their horizons as well and that's

759
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,560
never been the primary problem that

760
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,510
Facebook is trying to solve and and I

761
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,590
think it's something that we can do it's

762
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,330
something that someone else could do

763
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,100
using our platform or that someone else

764
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,380
could do using building it independently

765
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,430
and um you know I never bought the music

766
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,290
thing for MySpace

767
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,490
so I mean they they they kind of always

768
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,080
say that there were music service I'm

769
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,440
not sure why did they do that I don't

770
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,640
know if you have to ask them but hmm

771
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,380
maybe they can't they counted on bands

772
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,150
to spam their fans or something like

773
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,230
that that's a that's a powerful force in

774
00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:01,410
the world so before we go I want to ask

775
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:03,720
you about how you ended up out here do

776
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,160
you what was always the sort of how did

777
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,780
how did you end up in that house in Palo

778
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,520
Alto was it something you decided at the

779
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:13,230
last minute I don't actually remember

780
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,790
you know I remember bits of the story

781
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:20,490
but you know so I first I wrote the

782
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,580
first version of Facebook January of

783
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,560
2004 right and released it in February

784
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,570
and um the reason why I did in January

785
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,430
was was because at the time Harvard had

786
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,750
this intersession thing it's kind of

787
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,680
weird and I think that they don't have a

788
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,190
link period anymore

789
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,540
I think they've changed it so now

790
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,310
there's no now I started yeah well you

791
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,930
know now I'm bad because they try to

792
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,520
kick out everyone who starts anything

793
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:47,910
interesting there but um but that's huh

794
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,810
huh that's um but um I think that I

795
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,640
think that they're actually trying to

796
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:56,940
change that but um but it is striking

797
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,620
the so now they've made it I think so

798
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,390
finals or before you go away for

799
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,960
holidays but they have this thing before

800
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:05,250
where in January you basically just have

801
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,810
this dead month where you could study

802
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,730
for finals oh my gosh where you could

803
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,620
study for finals

804
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,350
ethically coming - you could study for

805
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,640
finals I wondered when I saw it was

806
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,110
started in January it was started in

807
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,520
reading period yeah and it was because

808
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,950
you had this time whether you weren't

809
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,410
too busy with stuff yeah although I

810
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,030
actually um I probably should have been

811
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,549
studying there's this other story that I

812
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,200
think is very funny which is um I was

813
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,669
taking this course Rome of Augustus and

814
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,660
it was it was one of the core curriculum

815
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:35,850
classes that we had in the final was the

816
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,919
these pieces of art that you study

817
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,830
throughout the class and then they give

818
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,910
you some on the final day they show you

819
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,380
some of the pieces of art and you have

820
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,940
to write about the historical

821
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,320
significance of them and you know I

822
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,390
hadn't really done much of the reading

823
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,640
in the class I mostly just spent my time

824
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,140
programming and building stuff that I

825
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,970
enjoyed and you know I could have used

826
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,250
reading period to to study for this but

827
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,230
instead I spent it reading a building

828
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,530
Facebook so instead what I did was I am

829
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,570
I hacked together this website where I

830
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,940
went and downloaded from from the course

831
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,500
website the 200 or so images that were

832
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,710
going to be potentially on the final and

833
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,390
I just built this very simple page site

834
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,850
where it showed one of the images and

835
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,380
then you could contribute what you

836
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,130
thought was significant about it and

837
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,600
then you can see what other people

838
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,760
thought was significant about it and

839
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,830
then I am and then you could go next to

840
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,179
note pulp a random one and and then I

841
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,580
emailed it to the class list I was like

842
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,500
hey guys I built a study tool anyone

843
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,020
that find this interesting and and

844
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,450
everyone just populated this thing for

845
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,540
me and it was wonderful and that the

846
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,309
professor after that they mentioned that

847
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,510
the grades on the final had never been

848
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,510
higher before so

849
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:50,929
Sonia so yeah so you Krauts were

850
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,539
studying so yeah so I'm pleased so and

851
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:55,370
you know a lot of interesting social

852
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:57,950
dynamics that you can apply to almost

853
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,860
any category that you choose to build

854
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,620
for but yeah so i built i built the

855
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,590
first version in january some of the

856
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,539
time I was at Harvard supposed to be

857
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,159
studying I actually went and visited a

858
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,750
couple of friends one who was at

859
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,889
Stanford and one who is out at Cal Tech

860
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,210
and and at the time I'd never really

861
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,860
been out to California before and you

862
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,539
went in January in January and what did

863
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,789
you think well I was really nice I

864
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,549
remember you know coming in to the like

865
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:26,899
affluent SFO and was driving down 101

866
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,429
and I saw these buildings for all these

867
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:30,320
companies like wow this is like where

868
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:31,639
these technologies company these

869
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,470
technology companies come from this is

870
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:37,789
amazing and and you know and then I just

871
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:41,510
looking at the weather also is awesome

872
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:42,710
and I remember I had been at Harvard for

873
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,559
a freshman year and I stayed there for

874
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,419
the summer and then sophomore year so by

875
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,159
the time that sophomore summer kind of

876
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,659
came around my friends and I were just

877
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,690
like okay well let's let's go somewhere

878
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:55,850
else right and let's rent a place in

879
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,649
California so we just had to get a place

880
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,179
in in Palo Alto and the idea at the time

881
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:01,010
wasn't that we actually were not

882
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:03,230
thinking about moving to California or

883
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,700
dropping out the actually the actual

884
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,370
thought that had crossed that was in our

885
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,659
mind was it'll be neat to be around some

886
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,029
of these other great companies that are

887
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:12,350
getting built one day maybe we'll find

888
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:15,679
something that will build a company out

889
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:19,070
of but surely this isn't it and so we

890
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,840
went out to California and and we just I

891
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,450
remember this conversation where one day

892
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,070
Dustin pulled me aside and was like you

893
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:29,330
know we were getting to have a lot of

894
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,830
users and where we are having an

895
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,600
increasing number of servers we have no

896
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:36,860
ops guy all right so we're the ops guy

897
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,779
and and this was before kind of ec2

898
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,909
right so you didn't have to so you have

899
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,409
to do more to manage manage your own

900
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:44,750
servers at that point and just like you

901
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:46,519
know this is this is really hard I don't

902
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,549
think that we can do this and take a

903
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,529
full course load so let's so Harvard has

904
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:54,080
this policy where you can take as much

905
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:56,179
time as you want off from school so why

906
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,410
don't we just take one term off and then

907
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,510
just try to get it under

908
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,160
and build the toolings that way we can

909
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,050
go back for spring semester and run it

910
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,070
more autonomously and and it'll grow and

911
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,130
we'll be able to run a more autonomous

912
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,510
lake so we did that and and of course we

913
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,070
raise money from Peter teal but we told

914
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,450
him the plan right and and kind of

915
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,800
explained what he told him you might go

916
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,640
back to school yeah and I think he

917
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,680
didn't believe us but you know smart new

918
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,240
wet work my life is just this long

919
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,070
history of people thinking I was going

920
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,290
to drop out well before I did but um but

921
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:29,270
so then you know spring term came along

922
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,040
and we hadn't quite built the tooling

923
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,510
and automation so you know let's take

924
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,340
another term off and then finally at

925
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,990
some point we we just figured that we

926
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,110
were that we were out there but by then

927
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,910
I mean we had no millions of users so

928
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,840
you didn't definitely decide not to go

929
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,150
back to hello

930
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,550
until you had millions of users oh yeah

931
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,110
yeah Wow hey I think I could still go

932
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,370
back Harvard Harvard is this policy

933
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,440
where you can go back for as long as you

934
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,900
want

935
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,940
whatever their policy was I'm sure they

936
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,890
would bend the rules in your case all

937
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,500
right are we are we done are we over is

938
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:01,930
there anybody watching the time well we

939
