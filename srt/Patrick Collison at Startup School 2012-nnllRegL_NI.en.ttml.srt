1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
morning hopefully this particular works

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,190
so I sat down to write this talk I

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,049
really racked my brains to try to figure

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,839
out what the most interesting and

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,859
relevant and and useful content would be

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
for a lot of people who are sort of

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,289
interested in web startups when I

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,420
thought about it in those terms the

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,420
topic of my talk became fairly obvious

10
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:34,230
but then but I thought about it more and

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,670
the algorithm doesn't even seem to be

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,170
deterministic I'm not sure anyone even

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,520
knows how it works so I guess I'll

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,379
actually have to talk about stripe

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:47,579
instead two years ago Brian from Airbnb

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,840
spoke at our school in 2010 and the open

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,789
is talked by showing a picture of

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,770
startup school in 2008 two years

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,230
previously and that picture showed a

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,420
snapshot of the audience I picked out

21
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,329
one particular head he was just sitting

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,190
there an anonymous had in the audience

23
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:05,100
and I know this because I was at his

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,220
talking 2010 and so curious later he was

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,020
on stage at school and somehow tears

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
later Here I am and I'm sure there's at

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,580
least one person here who who'd be on

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,350
stage in in two years time and stripe

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,439
definitely isn't as far along as Airbnb

30
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,330
but it read Rove home the point to me

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,759
when I realized this that startups are

32
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,840
very unpredictable um you know Sarge

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,329
there's really hard to get your head

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,060
around I remember somebody telling me

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,549
not all that long ago that that Airbnb

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,860
was just becoming a huge success they

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,930
were making something like $10,000 a

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,350
week remember thinking man that's really

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,479
impressive

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,189
and now I have no idea what Airbnb is

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,450
actual revenue figures are today but it

42
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,229
wouldn't it all shock me if they're

43
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,549
making $10,000 an hour like what's even

44
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,399
like to try to build a company where

45
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,579
that kind of growth is possible startups

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,719
are strange for a bunch more reasons you

47
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,009
know they're usually kind of

48
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,240
counterintuitive because if they were in

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,380
counterintuitive somebody else would

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,320
probably yourself ever the problem is

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,240
already and on top of that syrups often

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,069
don't actually want don't actually want

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,300
to be all that well understood it can

54
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,850
actually be quite helpful to be sort of

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,940
underestimated and under comprehended

56
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,800
um but I think the biggest reason that

57
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,770
startups are hard to understand is that

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,990
so few people still get to see them up

59
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,150
close during those first couple orders

60
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,400
of magnitude and when people do tell the

61
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,470
stories or when the stories are told

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,390
they often tend to be kind of wrong

63
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,400
they're about sort of rocket ships and

64
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,930
frantically holding on and trying to add

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,420
more server capacity as quickly as you

66
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,200
can to handle the next million users

67
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,270
they're not about the late night

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,760
arguments and wondering if your product

69
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,810
could ever possibly work or trying to

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,420
figure out once you've launched your

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,980
product why it's not growing and the

72
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,490
thing is even the really successful

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,230
startups have this phase but that that

74
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,110
famous summer when Facebook moved out to

75
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,940
Palo Alto in 2004 most people didn't

76
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,710
realize this but there were other people

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,270
in the same house working in other

78
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,100
startups like this is the most

79
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,620
successful technology company started in

80
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,760
the 21st century and in the same house

81
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,520
there were people working other startup

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,550
ideas as six months after launch its it

83
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,260
really takes a while and so stripe is

84
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,630
obviously very very different to

85
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,480
Facebook and Airbnb and and nowhere near

86
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,710
as sort of far along as they are but

87
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,030
we've now gone through a small bit of

88
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,300
growth and so I want to try to describe

89
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,790
how it how it actually works in October

90
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,060
of 2009 John and I were walking home

91
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,870
from dinner in Potrero up in the city

92
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,790
and we should have been kicking around

93
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,650
this idea of starting an online payments

94
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,240
company we're really kind of fascinated

95
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,650
by the concept of internet payments and

96
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,160
all the other companies in the space

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,600
seemed like total dinosaurs and it's the

98
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,920
web sort of spread around the world and

99
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,580
more deeply into our lives through

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,810
mobile devices

101
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,180
it seemed kind of obvious there should

102
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,830
be some kind of universal payments

103
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,570
infrastructure of the Internet though it

104
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,440
should be just really easy to transact

105
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,810
online and John just turned to me said

106
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,310
you know well didn't debate about it you

107
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,230
know how do we just go build it probably

108
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,910
won't be all that hard he actually said

109
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,410
that it probably would be all that hard

110
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,750
and so I said okay sure why not

111
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,720
backtrack a little bit here John is my

112
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,320
co-founder right stripe um he's Alta my

113
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,390
brother and people often asked me about

114
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,100
how this works in practice and so for

115
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,390
the record starting a company with your

116
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,550
brother turns out to your really good

117
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,960
idea John is not only one of most

118
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,850
brilliant people I know I think he got

119
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,010
the highest-ever results in ireland's

120
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,150
university entrance examinations but

121
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,010
he's also someone with whom I've

122
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,320
literally decades of experience building

123
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:40,000
things here's an an earlier venture that

124
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,010
we worked on together and so it's

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,930
October 2009 we decide to work in this

126
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,290
online payments company we decided to

127
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,970
call it slash dev slash payments you

128
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,980
know the API should be just as

129
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,040
straightforward as any other node in dev

130
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,830
FS we're kind of okay at programming and

131
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,120
definitely not at naming things but

132
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,130
everyone else seriously have been

133
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,690
targeting their product it's like they

134
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,580
told was it a finance sector product

135
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,560
they were targeting is CFO's and at

136
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,120
business people and we thought the

137
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,860
internet was just moving in a completely

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,330
different direction and we decided to

139
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,640
target makers the people actually

140
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,830
building things we thought that internet

141
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,510
payments was a technology problem and we

142
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,630
wanted to build a completely new stack

143
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,400
for anybody transacting online so we

144
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,960
work nights and weekends we were both in

145
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,670
college at the time I was at MIT and

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,870
John was up the road at Harvard and so

147
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,890
we'd code together in the evenings

148
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,360
between problem sets and writing papers

149
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,530
January rolled rounds which for both of

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,870
those schools you sort of have that

151
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,280
month off but of course anybody who

152
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,500
knows Boston knows that January in

153
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,460
Boston is unbelievably freezing and so

154
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,650
we decide to go somewhere else to work

155
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,720
for the month we'd read a few blogs that

156
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,400
claim that Buenos Aires was surprisingly

157
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,920
a really good place to get things done

158
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,960
it's it's pretty cheap it's really warm

159
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,240
its friendly for some reason I don't

160
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,290
know why there was Wi-Fi everywhere

161
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,730
everything happens on a really late

162
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,080
schedule like the bars are open till

163
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,090
5:00 a.m. nobody has dinner until

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,370
midnight and nothing nothing starts

165
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,800
before noon and it's busy a city on a

166
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,300
program reschedule

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,759
and so you read all this and we're like

168
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,680
great we're good of one azari's and so

169
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,379
we did and we just worked non-stop in

170
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,300
cafes for three weeks I've still never

171
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,220
seen a single one of like the tourist

172
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,330
attractions in Buenos Aires or I presume

173
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,409
they exist and and then we'd like we

174
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,060
could all day and we'd go to dinner

175
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,300
eleven o'clock or something and then go

176
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,360
to bed

177
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,680
um I can't have a size isn't enough if

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,970
you want to get something done consider

179
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,900
going to minus R Eason

180
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:35,229
On January 9 we we got our first

181
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,979
production user for left / dad flex

182
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:40,180
payments I can't really say it and this

183
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,250
is only a few weeks after we started

184
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,259
working on it but we really wanted to

185
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,750
get production users shaping a product

186
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,520
as quickly as we could the user was a

187
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,960
friend of ours a guy called Russ Boucher

188
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,880
was working a company called trading

189
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,919
north at the time who's also actually YC

190
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,419
funded and funnily enough he actually

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,719
became the seventh person to work at

192
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:00,039
stripe but that's a separate story and

193
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:01,810
here's a screenshot of what debt

194
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,039
payments looked like at the time and

195
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,479
this screenshot you can see that John

196
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,020
and I are definitely programmers and app

197
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,340
designers but okay so January 9th

198
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,340
we now have one user and

199
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,160
this is a great story from the early

200
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,540
days of Amazon that I have a celebrated

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,200
when they got their first fire who

202
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,090
wasn't any of their moms and you know

203
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,100
Ross wasn't exactly our mom but he was a

204
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,560
good friend and so he definitely weren't

205
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,240
out of the woods just yet so he went

206
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,800
back to school and weakened huge work on

207
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,210
death payments in our spare time there

208
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,620
was this one cafe that I worked out of

209
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,880
so much they like took pity on me and

210
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm still Facebook friends with a bunch

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,400
of the Bruce says that's yeah like

212
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,410
strife is a kind of unusual company

213
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,660
we're about technology but we're also

214
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,300
about payments and the technology side

215
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,100
requires good reliability and you know

216
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,170
clean API is an really nice product and

217
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,480
sort of lots of technology things we at

218
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,220
least hope to know something about but

219
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,570
the payment side requires working with

220
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,820
banks and dealing with credit card

221
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,130
companies and just generally handling a

222
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,770
slew of finance industry issue issues

223
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,600
through really had no experience with a

224
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,100
no idea how to handle we had a lot of

225
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,310
meetings where I sort of sat somebody

226
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,370
down and said right so payments how do

227
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,230
they work and you know programmers often

228
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,550
and this is unfortunate so looked down

229
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,350
at the folks who are trying to learn to

230
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,450
code the sort of I want to learn real to

231
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,130
my web startup crowd but I actually

232
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,490
bought a sympathy for them because we

233
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,410
were that but put in finance somewhere

234
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,210
came around when I was six months in we

235
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,380
moved out to Palo Alto and though we

236
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,240
hadn't actually yet decided to take a

237
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,850
leave from school we found a tiny

238
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,770
bungalow at just off University Ave the

239
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,780
living room and the kitchen became our

240
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,400
office it was pretty hot reading of any

241
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,320
air-conditioning and so John just slept

242
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,340
in the garden most nights and he

243
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,150
wouldn't allow me to post a picture of

244
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,650
this um and by and large we just kept on

245
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,910
writing code because I mean that's

246
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,170
mostly what starting a software company

247
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,390
looks like in the early days you're

248
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,710
either writing code or you're talking to

249
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,930
people who use the code or you're

250
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,790
probably wasting time and here's a chart

251
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,040
of our transaction volume over the first

252
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,920
six months and and that's not a

253
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,050
technical error if you look really

254
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,140
closely even see a tiny little wiggly

255
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,650
line at the bottom it's admittedly not

256
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,970
wiggling all that much around this time

257
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,610
though we did of our first person join

258
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,960
we're based in Silicon Valley home to

259
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,750
the best international talents from

260
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,350
Berlin to Beijing to Bangalore and so of

261
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,640
course we took

262
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,200
advantage of it we heard a guy called

263
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,270
DARAB Utley who was one of my smartest

264
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,710
friends from college and he grew up in a

265
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,570
small town called Limerick in Ireland

266
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:39,290
about two miles from her John and I grew

267
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,390
up we altar rates our first investment I

268
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,010
have a first real investment I guess YC

269
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,040
had obviously already invested and and

270
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,900
this was from from Peter teal after then

271
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,880
we hadn't told very many people about

272
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,260
dev payments and those we had told had

273
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,810
reacted mostly by telling us we were

274
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,770
crazy but of course luckily Peter teal

275
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,330
is crazy and so he invested and it's

276
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,460
been really helpful to have him on board

277
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,230
soon after that moved into our first

278
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,500
office and which looked something like

279
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,630
this it's actually sort of it's it's a

280
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,430
Ramona in University and Palo Alto just

281
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,840
next sort of koopa cafe that's actually

282
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,400
a converted house and because it was a

283
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,530
house it had this wonderful fireplace

284
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,460
they were able to light in the winter

285
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,930
the fireplace looks something like this

286
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,100
which I think may have contravenes some

287
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,310
fire in the workplace codes and

288
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,770
basically we're just working non-stop

289
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,360
we we actually have we became four

290
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,860
people around this time that the first

291
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,540
person fourth person was a guy named

292
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,490
Greg I remember

293
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,530
when Greg was considering joining and

294
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,210
dropping out of school he asked me about

295
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,310
our work schedule and whether or not we

296
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,630
worked weekends obviously we did work

297
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,100
weekends but it really didn't want to

298
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,690
make it sort of scare him off and make

299
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,430
it seem like he'd have to answer so I

300
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,990
sort of said well you know we usually

301
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,640
work some of the weekend we really care

302
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,810
about work-life balance and Greg just

303
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
cut me off and he's like great I'm

304
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,880
better on the same page I working all

305
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,240
day every day and so we knew he'd fit in

306
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,680
we decided to change our name I can't

307
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,480
even begin to list the problems that

308
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,950
flashed as slash payments had somehow it

309
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,770
turned out that not everyone immediately

310
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,880
got the deficit analogy nobody was

311
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,200
really able to get their head around the

312
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,820
whole slash thing and we started to get

313
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,820
mail with things like this

314
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,350
and and then there was the admittedly

315
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,789
pretty inconvenient fact that Amazon had

316
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,669
launched a product an online payments

317
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:23,079
product called Amazon dev pay and so if

318
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,629
Precure this wasn't going to work out

319
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,069
and so we spent hours brainstorming

320
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,350
names and we eventually came up with the

321
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:30,429
name stripe and we didn't actually think

322
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,629
that stripe was all that great a name

323
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,589
when we first came up with it but we

324
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,850
decide to just put a date in the

325
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,069
calendar and if we didn't cover the

326
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,049
better name by that date then we'd

327
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,579
secret stripe and sure enough it became

328
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,899
stripe and actually a few months later I

329
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:42,189
learned that this is our Apple ended up

330
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,389
with the name Apple it's the exact same

331
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:48,489
date thing anyway reach the end of our

332
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,109
first year mostly intact a bunch of Y

333
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,519
Combinator companies start to use stripe

334
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,679
and that was pretty good we're getting

335
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,600
some real feedback and here's another

336
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,939
chart this is our transaction volume

337
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,489
through the first year and so you can

338
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:03,339
see still kind of a ways to go we spent

339
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:05,319
January 2011 or when your anniversary in

340
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,910
Rio de Janeiro because January in South

341
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:08,109
America was not becoming a tradition as

342
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,669
anyone who's been to Rio de Janeiro

343
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:12,399
knows it's one of the most beautiful

344
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:15,149
places on earth and of course we took

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,149
full advantage of it

346
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,330
at this point we're still an invite-only

347
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
private beta and so there probably is

348
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,570
something obvious we could have done to

349
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,760
grow at least a little bit faster ie to

350
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,370
launch a friend refers to invite only

351
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,730
private beta as the baby blanket of

352
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,900
startups and I think that's about right

353
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,630
but the beta period was actually really

354
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,550
helpful to stripe um amber Paul Buchheit

355
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,800
saying that should start out by making

356
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,050
hundred people really happy rather than

357
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,360
many more people only a little bit happy

358
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,310
I mean you really took this to heart and

359
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,960
took advantage of the the small number

360
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,610
of users to sort of really focus on them

361
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,380
as much as we could and so really try to

362
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,030
figure out what they wanted it's a

363
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,560
forgettable not long after we launched

364
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,240
the first version of strife we added

365
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,830
pager duty so we'd all get calls from

366
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,750
the side was down you pretty standard

367
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,540
and pretty reasonable but then we

368
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,920
realized that any time a user gets any

369
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,450
kind of error like even if the site

370
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,070
isn't down that's actually a really bad

371
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,020
experience for them and we could

372
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,400
probably make them much happier if we

373
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,810
went and investigated the error and sort

374
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,480
of proactively reach out to them and

375
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,460
helped him fix it and so we changed the

376
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,190
code a little bit so that anytime anyone

377
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,330
hit any error it would send an email

378
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,580
that would go sort of straight the top

379
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,490
of everybody's inbox and would also

380
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,530
phone everybody and and we'd go and fix

381
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,790
it no matter what and I really mean that

382
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,400
like we would get out of bed if

383
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,440
necessary and we're basically never

384
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,220
without a laptop and the means to tether

385
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,330
here's a photo of one such incident

386
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,370
this is bragging eye we'd gone to the

387
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,750
cinema in Redwood City a user

388
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,280
encountered an error and so of course

389
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,350
out came our laptops and we had to go

390
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,550
fix it I think Greg I think Greg is here

391
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,720
summer actually and I think he still

392
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,120
feels a little bit bitter about missing

393
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,440
the start of the movie over this and the

394
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,250
movie may or may not have been Twilight

395
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,730
Breaking Dawn start ups are high stress

396
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,730
you need to unwind

397
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,209
we also realized that I am in with an

398
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,560
engineer is basically the best support

399
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,389
experience possible like it's really

400
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,759
frustrating to have to go in to file a

401
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,019
ticket and more like find the support

402
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,160
email address and then wonder does this

403
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,509
come to actually apply to their support

404
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,519
emails or if they do reply how long does

405
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:16,959
it take them or all these issues like

406
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,550
it's much nice we can just start sort of

407
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,230
directly chatting with somebody and it's

408
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,790
also way more productive for us because

409
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,290
we can then go and sort of try to figure

410
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,459
out what the underlying issue is rather

411
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,230
than having to sort of guess based on

412
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:28,360
the user's initial description so we

413
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,769
just opened up this this chat system on

414
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,089
our website where anyone can jump in and

415
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,470
just start asking questions and we

416
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,019
actually still have this today and that

417
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,629
was it was really good but then we

418
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:39,519
thought why stop there

419
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:41,290
isn't it really a really bad experience

420
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,360
when somebody asks a question and

421
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,029
there's nobody there to answer them and

422
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,560
so we thought aha pager duty and so we

423
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,180
hooked it up so that if you asked a

424
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,829
question in the Striped chat room and

425
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,060
there was nobody there to answer you it

426
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:54,279
would go and phone one of us after 30

427
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,290
seconds and so I don't think many people

428
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,819
know this for like for many months at

429
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,810
stripe if you asked a question in our

430
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,189
chat room and there's no one there to

431
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,250
answer someone will be woken up if

432
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:05,399
necessary to help you we don't do that

433
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,399
tonight

434
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,870
and so those stripe wasn't yet publicly

435
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,730
available to everyone we really tried to

436
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,500
sort of turn up the dial on our users

437
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,360
feedback and to force ourselves to be

438
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,000
extremely sensitive to what they wanted

439
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,100
and to what their experience was like we

440
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,350
our users talking to us during every

441
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,910
waking hour and if anything went wrong

442
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,550
for them they were like literally

443
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,569
interrupting our sleep the other thing

444
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,160
that kept us in beta was the fact we

445
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,750
weren't just building a thin software

446
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,069
layer and we thought that stripe should

447
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,600
encompass everything from the API

448
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,620
requests to have the money ended up in

449
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,329
your bank account and we wanted to be

450
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,040
able to define the complete experience

451
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,740
and we wanted to be able to do it at

452
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,870
scale we were sort of really influenced

453
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,149
by things like Amazon Web Services in

454
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,730
ec2 which just it's really interesting

455
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,019
innovation because ec2 is fantastic if

456
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,550
you're a small company or a startup

457
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,920
startup or a side project or something

458
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,199
like this but its scale is right through

459
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,990
to be a Netflix or a Zynga or indeed an

460
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:01,209
Amazon it'll work for a company of any

461
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,439
size and we decided that we wanted to do

462
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,730
that but for internet payments

463
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,019
infrastructure we wanted to make

464
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,730
something that was really easy to start

465
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:08,889
with but something would also work for

466
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,970
the largest companies in the world until

467
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,740
that meant working with really good

468
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,820
banks

469
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,810
but the problem is that banks and

470
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,180
startups are basically the business

471
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,520
equivalent of oil and water and figuring

472
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,630
out how to combine them is pretty hard

473
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,920
the best bank in the business is

474
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,060
probably Wells Fargo which powers some

475
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
of the largest payments companies in the

476
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,680
world and honestly it was pretty tough

477
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,990
to get them to talk to us or us even to

478
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,100
like return our emails and they probably

479
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,230
thought were some strange kind of

480
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,640
Nigerian scam like make money online

481
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,170
fast all from the comfort of your own

482
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,610
home so we asked a friend and investor

483
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,370
actually now a partner at Y Combinator

484
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,660
Jeff Ralston to help out Jeff had

485
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,149
previously been CEO of a company called

486
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,500
Lala an online music startup and they

487
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,209
had negotiated successfully with the

488
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,250
record labels and we thought that if you

489
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,600
could as a technology startup could say

490
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,770
it successfully with record labels you

491
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,070
could basically convince anyone in the

492
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,630
world to do anything ever and here's a

493
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,520
picture of Jeff on a conference call

494
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,160
with Wells Fargo and that's that's Dara

495
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,370
there on the other side and you might

496
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,660
wonder why is Jeff from the floor well

497
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,270
Jeff is on the floor because our office

498
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,449
was also flooded at the time and we also

499
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,949
had a security audit that day sometimes

500
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,839
turrets are just like a reality TV show

501
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,490
it's like negotiate with one of the

502
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,679
biggest banks in the world while

503
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,079
undergoing a security audit while

504
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,160
waiting through water and I don't know

505
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,480
the water is full of piranhas or

506
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,890
something but I see Jeff and a bunch of

507
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,750
others we eventually convinced Wells

508
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,460
Fargo to become one of our backends this

509
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,809
meant moving all of our systems to work

510
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,280
on top of their platform and was a

511
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,780
couple of weeks of honestly really

512
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,330
intense work we had to sort of hit a

513
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,510
particular deadline this is the night of

514
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,280
our first successful transaction this is

515
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,190
John after another particularly long

516
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,600
all-nighter and in general and I kind of

517
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,670
mean this seriously like this is the

518
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,800
unglamorous site of startups that people

519
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,600
do not get to see all that much like you

520
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,860
really want to make something work and a

521
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,500
lot of other people think that it's a

522
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,080
bad idea and it's really hard and

523
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,960
everything happens much much slower than

524
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,520
you like and you've sort of many late

525
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,140
night discussions like this and sort of

526
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,179
soul-searching debates and wondering

527
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,830
like this is actually a good idea or

528
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,860
maybe it is a good idea but it's just

529
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:17,130
too hard for us to pull off and syrups

530
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,420
are hard and the thing is this doesn't

531
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,500
actually go away this is the thing that

532
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,460
I didn't realize before doing a startup

533
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,169
I thought that sort of you have all

534
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,609
these doubts in the early days

535
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,249
then it was hard to take off and things

536
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:28,109
would get easy but no matter how

537
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:30,570
successful you will have lots of doubts

538
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:32,190
and the first American to win the trade

539
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,470
of France was a guy called Greg Lomond

540
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,039
and he has this quote I've always really

541
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,470
liked it doesn't get easier you just got

542
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,539
to go faster and it's kind of like this

543
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,249
foot startups like the startup might

544
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:47,759
might start going faster but it doesn't

545
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:49,109
really get easier in our case we

546
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,639
eventually got the pieces in place and

547
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:53,220
we got to the point for ready to launch

548
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:57,749
we launched in the 29th of September

549
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,700
2011 so just over a year ago at that

550
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:02,850
time stripe didn't predict had been in

551
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,470
production use for 19 months and and

552
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,359
we've been working at full time for a

553
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,100
year and three months

554
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,309
we're ten people when we launched I fail

555
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,320
to fit all the names in a tree and by

556
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,720
the end of the year here's what our

557
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,730
daily transaction volume looked like you

558
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,730
know kind of promising but the launching

559
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,149
is definitely not a panacea but the

560
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,820
signs were positive and we kept going

561
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:29,279
and over the last few months like two

562
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,899
and a half years in stripe is finally

563
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,389
started to become an overnight success

564
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,009
Jessica talked about how startups are

565
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:37,529
our roller coasters and there's a lot of

566
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:38,730
downs but there's also ups and the next

567
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:42,049
slide is our daily transaction volume

568
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,049
through to today and it looks like this

569
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,460
from being four people not all that long

570
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,990
ago stripe is now 34 people which is

571
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,850
actually twice as many people as are in

572
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,900
this picture because everything is

573
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,130
always behind them I start off and we

574
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,400
haven't got around to taking our new

575
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,810
group shot yet and many thousands of

576
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,310
companies are using stripe and a lot of

577
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,510
new ones go live every day and I mean

578
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,110
it's a bunch of well-known brands like

579
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:16,540
Foursquare and foxy and Hipmunk and the

580
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,770
FF and New York moment but a lot of less

581
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,880
well-known ones too and and they

582
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,740
actually tend to be sort of just as

583
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,690
interesting there's things like good

584
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,900
eggs which enables you to buy directly

585
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,730
from local farmers or samasource which

586
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,680
brings computer-based work to people

587
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,090
living in poverty or even stuff like the

588
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,210
Bedford cheese shop which is never just

589
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,650
selling its cheese online I guess I just

590
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,650
hungry you guys making these slides and

591
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,850
she seemed like a good idea okay um

592
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,580
has anyone here ever looked into the

593
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,750
history of container shipping sorry I

594
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,070
know this is a context switch from

595
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,630
cheese container shipping like and the

596
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,640
shipping container like those 40-foot

597
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,900
shipping containers on some level

598
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,400
they're the most mundane thing in the

599
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,050
world and we see them around all the

600
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,770
time but there were actually an

601
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,920
absolutely enormous innovation sixty

602
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,270
years ago before shipping containers

603
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,760
transportation was a massive issue with

604
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,550
physical goods transportation costs

605
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,950
often accounted for up to 25 percent of

606
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:17,110
the final cost of a physical item and

607
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,330
overall transportation costs and

608
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,640
shipping costs were like 10 percent of

609
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,220
the value of all the imports in the US

610
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,530
like think about that from a 10% that

611
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,910
means if your margins 20 percent just by

612
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,760
bringing you're good to another market

613
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,380
you cut your profit in half and so

614
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,060
unsurprisingly most manufacturing

615
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,640
happens are very close to where a

616
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,840
physical product was consumed until the

617
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,950
shipping container invented in the

618
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,170
mid-1950s

619
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,210
essentially eliminated the cost of

620
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,150
shipping physical goods it cut the cost

621
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,580
of loading and unloading ships by 95%

622
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,320
and it's now at the point 4 and actually

623
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,360
quoting this from a US government report

624
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,890
it's better to assume that moving goods

625
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,970
is essentially costless really and the

626
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,920
history here is fascinating there's a

627
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,720
few kind of good books about it but the

628
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,330
point is like this technological

629
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,670
breakthrough and sort of this

630
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,040
of friction and a particular this

631
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,170
abstraction of our geography it played

632
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,790
an enormous role in in facilitating the

633
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,470
rise of Singapore and South Korea and

634
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,980
Taiwan and Japan and China as

635
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,540
manufacturing hubs and we pointed really

636
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,310
that a technology that doesn't just

637
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,890
monetize itself but actually enables

638
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,110
newcomers can really enormous impact

639
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,870
like the shipping container literally

640
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,070
reshaped the world's economy

641
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,690
we sometimes subscribe we're doing with

642
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,840
stripe as building economic

643
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,150
infrastructure for the Internet it's not

644
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,670
very flashy but for most of human

645
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,670
history we've had to buy from the people

646
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,370
beside us but and thanks to the internet

647
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:47,370
that's no longer true we have a new way

648
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:50,460
to abstract over place anyone can now

649
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,050
build a global business but yeah while

650
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,940
the Internet has revolutionized how we

651
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,760
communicate and how we collaborate and

652
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,310
how we share we've only sort of started

653
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,920
to explore how that can change what we

654
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,750
create and how we transact and what kind

655
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,010
of business is possible and a lot of the

656
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,870
other companies whose founders are

657
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:10,380
speaking today are pretty good examples

658
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,970
of that it's with stripe we simply want

659
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,640
to turn payments into a ubiquitous

660
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,850
utility we want more commerce on the

661
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,260
Internet

662
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,790
but it's still really early days and

663
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,400
honestly most of the time we're not

664
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,960
thinking about these kinds of problems

665
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,350
we're trying figure I had to decrease

666
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,540
the load on DB 3 or trying to get some

667
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:34,050
particular design you know just right

668
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,550
and working for the 20th iteration we're

669
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,190
wondering if some particular product is

670
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,480
a good idea or having some debate you

671
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,340
know in Gmail that's so long we've

672
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,870
overflowed the Gmail thread limit and

673
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,510
it's now become something completely new

674
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:48,600
thread or like it's all the the

675
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,150
day-to-day stuff but you know it turns

676
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,220
out that all the high-level stuff the

677
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,470
the larger motivations and the bigger

678
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,690
ideas and the day-to-day implementation

679
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,450
like the debates and the tweaking and

680
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,250
the and the iterations both of them are

681
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,720
really addictive and that's why we keep

682
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,720
doing this thank you
