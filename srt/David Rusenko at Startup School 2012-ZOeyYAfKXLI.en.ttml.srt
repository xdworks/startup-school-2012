1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,920
well thanks for having me guys you hear

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,600
me alright cool so I wanted to start by

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,490
just going over the Weebly story a

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,830
little bit telling you kind of how we

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,559
got to where we got to today and some of

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,330
the lessons we learned along the way so

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,830
what is Weebly first of all is if some

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,770
of you guys haven't heard of it

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,779
Weebly is a simple and powerful way to

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,400
create a site people want to create a

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,470
site they want to create a blog they

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,000
want to sell things online and they just

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,300
want to work they don't want any of the

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,730
frustrations around it so let me show

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,149
you a couple Weebly sites the first site

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,000
is a photographer from Toronto

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,520
showcasing their photography the second

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,050
site is an interior designer from Oregon

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,370
these they've actually been featured in

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,800
dwell magazine for their interior

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,930
designs run their website on Weebly the

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,520
third side is a graphic designer from

23
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,000
California can see all these sites just

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,329
look great

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,480
and not one line of HTML or CSS was

26
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,719
written for these sites this next site

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,149
is pretty special this is Brian he's 80

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,549
years old he retired and his passion is

29
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,439
building ukuleles and he started doing

30
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,630
his spare time went on Weebly and

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,159
created a website what do you know the

32
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,689
word got out and you know he could build

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,090
a couple ukuleles out of a shop per

34
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,570
month he now has a three to six month

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,130
back order of ukuleles and this last

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,200
site is really special to us

37
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,070
you may have seen that along with not

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,330
initiative I think last year but but

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,970
this group of students who had

40
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,640
volunteered in Kenya heard this story

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,689
about Omari that had been brutally

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,829
attacked while trying to fend his

43
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,600
orphanage and they didn't even have a

44
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,130
fence to defend themselves so they

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,680
created a Weebly website about this

46
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,619
posted it to Reddit and were able to

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,570
raise over $100,000 in less than a week

48
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,040
for the orphanage and they built a they

49
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,880
built a wall and a fence and much more

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,479
than that and that's actually now

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,649
helping out that orphanage in Kenya so a

52
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,340
little bit about our story and how we

53
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,329
got to where we are today in early 2006

54
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,219
as part of a class project at Penn State

55
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,960
we were came up with the same idea six

56
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,990
years ago we thought you know why is

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,369
this so hard why is it still so hard to

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,470
build a website we're seeing people all

59
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,570
around us that we're just struggling

60
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,190
and so we came up with the idea we start

61
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,780
working on now I'm gonna introduce you

62
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,200
to the theme in the presentation here

63
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:24,070
this is a graph of our new signups per

64
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,350
day now this is August 2006 this is real

65
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,880
data and you can see up at the top it's

66
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:32,230
six months after we started working on

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,090
Weebly so six months six months after we

68
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,990
wrote our first line of code our grand

69
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,980
sign of day we got 12 new users and you

70
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,840
know it's just kind of friends and

71
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,920
family it was so alpha stage this wasn't

72
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,270
something that was easy to pump out a

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,520
month is something that was difficult

74
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,960
that took some time to build so over

75
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,100
that summer dan and I and Chris were

76
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,470
working on it

77
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,060
here's October 2006 eight months later

78
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,090
so we've now been writing code and

79
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,370
working on the idea for eight months we

80
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,080
posted a private beta invitation on some

81
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,720
forums and we thought man this is gonna

82
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,290
blow up and we got about 30 people

83
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,840
signed up that day so you know around

84
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,550
this time I was up pretty late at night

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,290
was browsing / thought that kind of

86
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,760
tells you also you know that was the

87
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,400
most popular tech news site back then

88
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,959
and I was reading an article on Y

89
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,130
Combinator I said you know I think I've

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,050
heard about this coming before I'm not

91
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,250
really sure started reading the article

92
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,700
oh this sounds really cool it sounds

93
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,370
interesting

94
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,370
Oh application deadlines in two hours so

95
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,510
well I thought you know what the hell

96
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,650
I'll put something together really quick

97
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,780
you know it doesn't hurt to apply now I

98
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,970
didn't actually have enough time to call

99
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,880
a Dan or Chris to ask them if they'd be

100
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,120
willing to drop out of school moved to

101
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,190
San Francisco so I took a guess I

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,510
figured you know Chris would probably do

103
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,269
it he's a little he's a pretty wild guy

104
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,709
and Dan's a pretty wild guy too but but

105
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,980
I figured he might want to finish his

106
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,080
college career so you know we we applied

107
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,440
to YC with literally less than an hour

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,560
to go on the clock got accepted for an

109
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,880
interview drove up to Boston interviewed

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,280
we thought we thought it was great

111
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,870
incidentally the morning of the

112
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,930
interview I wake up check my phone I'm

113
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,070
ringing email bleary-eyed and and I got

114
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,200
an email from someone Congrats on the

115
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,180
tech crunching what the hell is this

116
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,130
about so open TechCrunch is just so

117
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,550
happened that TechCrunch operated by us

118
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,110
that morning the

119
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,200
you know I'm sure it definitely didn't

120
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,400
hurt with the interview but I also had

121
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,460
to explain this graph this is really

122
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,100
important this is not normally what a

123
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,970
tech crunching looks like normally it

124
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,860
goes straight up and straight back down

125
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,150
we had an invitation system in place you

126
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,090
know make sure our servers didn't crash

127
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,520
and so that's why I see it spread out

128
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,970
over more time but you know later that

129
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,890
night though you know Paul told us

130
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,750
expect a call from us by 7:00 p.m. the

131
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,520
same day we'll let you know if he made

132
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,520
it or not so you know we were pretty

133
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,990
nervous and we went out to dinner and we

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,640
sat down and literally I remember you

135
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,410
know 7:00 p.m. rolled around and 8:00

136
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,640
p.m. rolled around and we were all just

137
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,350
staring at our plates of food in front

138
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,240
of us like we literally couldn't eat we

139
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,410
were so nervous and then by 9:00 p.m.

140
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,150
we're like this is it we're definitely

141
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,820
not making it in they've called everyone

142
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,230
they've accepted and now they're just

143
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,490
calling the losers that aren't getting

144
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:18,260
in so I think around 9:00 9:30 the phone

145
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,700
call from Paul comes and I answer and

146
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,430
literally his first words were I'm

147
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,430
calling to end your college career so

148
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,060
you know funnily enough you know I ended

149
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,950
up talking to Dan later and say hey guys

150
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,570
you wanna do you wanna you know I know

151
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,770
we have a semester left but it sounds

152
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,750
crazy but how about we just drop out of

153
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,950
school moved to San Francisco what do

154
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,640
you think of it and Chris was like hell

155
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,270
yeah let's do it

156
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,650
and and as Dan I'm like Dan like what do

157
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,730
you think this is pretty crazy he's like

158
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,960
yeah I'm on board that sounds awesome so

159
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,880
you know this is this is a picture of us

160
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,490
that we took right after we got that

161
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,430
phone call I think this picture was also

162
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,770
right after we each took three shots at

163
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,490
the bar to celebrate and this is with

164
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,830
our friend Dana so the next graph is

165
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,960
January 2007 so we move out to San

166
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,570
Francisco start the Y Combinator program

167
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,590
it's now 11 months after we started

168
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,240
working on Weebly you know this is a

169
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,380
pretty long time this is almost a full

170
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,940
year after you started writing our first

171
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,530
line of code I want you to take a look

172
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,060
at this graph and I want you to notice

173
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,670
something

174
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,900
this isn't straight up into the right it

175
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,490
goes straight up it comes straight back

176
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,870
down now maybe you got a couple

177
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,430
squiggles here that a little that are a

178
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,570
little hopeful but things aren't looking

179
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,010
great we're getting less than a hundred

180
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,080
people per day signing up right now

181
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,560
almost a year after we started working

182
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,150
on Weebly

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,220
you know this is a picture of our first

184
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,450
office so we literally moved into an

185
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,770
apartment

186
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,060
we put three desks together you could

187
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,620
really tell how long ago this was

188
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,110
because that old-ass TV in the lower

189
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,510
right-hand corner and then and the

190
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,220
15-inch monitors and we literally just

191
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,810
pushed three desks together put it in

192
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,240
the living room and this is this is what

193
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,590
startup looks like we just worked our

194
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,290
asses off we had one important rule

195
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,330
which is we took Saturday off but

196
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,990
otherwise every other moment every other

197
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,250
waking moment was 24/7 work wasn't all

198
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,130
bad we had a great view of the San

199
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,680
Francisco Bay and you know this is this

200
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,120
is a fun story this is a little display

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,010
that Chris hacked up and he just put it

202
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,390
in the middle of the table and it showed

203
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,500
kind of some basic stats so it showed

204
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,960
like load average which you don't see

205
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,960
right here but it also showed total

206
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,340
users and logged in users and there's

207
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,660
three logging users here that's because

208
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:32,300
it was a three of us around the table

209
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:34,130
using Weebly and one of the one of our

210
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,900
biggest moments still I think in company

211
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,050
history was one night we were sitting

212
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:44,510
there and it went for you know and like

213
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:46,970
we were excited that was exciting so you

214
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,110
know in January 2007 we also got

215
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,729
featured on TechCrunch again this is

216
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,220
much more normal it goes straight up and

217
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,720
straight back down and you know again 11

218
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,950
months after we started working on

219
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,860
Weebly

220
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,210
this is April 2007 and there's a couple

221
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,229
hard times I also want to share cuz

222
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,400
sometimes you just hear about the good

223
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,870
stuff you don't hear about the bad stuff

224
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,210
you don't hear about the times were

225
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,350
really hard this is 14 months after you

226
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,850
start working on Whaley now the first

227
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,020
thing I want to address on this slide is

228
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,570
the signup graph I kind of want you to

229
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,160
look at the end there and notice you

230
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,020
know I think we were just oblivious and

231
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,660
very hopeful the time but that kind of

232
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,100
looks like it's heading down it's not

233
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,220
heading up it's actually heading in the

234
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,840
wrong direction at this point in April

235
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,820
2007 I mean we were just finishing the

236
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,229
YC program we were really hopeful that

237
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,330
we could raise money but you know

238
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:33,589
talking to some angel investors but at

239
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,050
one point we had less than 100 bucks in

240
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:39,289
our bank account and that's all the

241
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,940
money we had we you know we spent money

242
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,909
on two things early on we spent money on

243
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,540
rent and we spent money at the bar

244
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,730
and and and that's pretty much it and

245
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,259
you know we were pretty hopeful but rent

246
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,310
was coming up in two weeks and we had to

247
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:52,389
pay rent in two weeks so we started

248
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,519
talking about raising a friends and

249
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:56,350
family around we started talking about

250
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,620
moving to San Jose to save 800 bucks a

251
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:04,959
month and rent and luckily we didn't do

252
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,160
that yeah and you know luckily sort of

253
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,440
right in the nick of time

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,009
we end up raising 650k angel round from

255
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,889
from Ron from Steve Anderson Mike maples

256
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:17,620
a bunch of angels this is another thing

257
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:19,209
that really dates this story that big

258
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,790
stack of paperwork is when equity

259
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,019
financing looks like these days you know

260
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,790
all the financing most really stage

261
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,459
finances are done via convertible note

262
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:31,269
to three pages tops this is a fat stack

263
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:33,399
for an equity financing so you know the

264
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,779
next big thing for us was being featured

265
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,329
in Newsweek now this used to be of a

266
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,709
really big deal I don't know today if

267
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,940
it's as much of a big deal but back then

268
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,009
this was a huge deal this was the thing

269
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,899
that your parents like bought 10 copies

270
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:47,829
the magazine afford it to everyone they

271
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:49,449
knew and so this was a really big deal

272
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:52,779
15 months in that that was definitely a

273
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:55,000
high point and that's what that looks

274
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,500
like so now you're seeing the effect of

275
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,880
what being featured in Newsweek looks

276
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,860
like you know again it's a very similar

277
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,740
pattern it goes up and it comes right

278
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,959
back down you're now noticing you know

279
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,920
it settles higher that's definitely a

280
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,759
good sign but it's still going down it's

281
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:16,089
not going up this is 15 months after we

282
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:19,480
started working on Weebly you know

283
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:22,300
here's a shot of our office here in in

284
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,490
July 2007 and it's that's Dan sitting

285
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,630
there and that's also our stats

286
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,149
dashboard that you could kind of see

287
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,939
what's going on next big moment for us

288
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,560
around the same time was being featured

289
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:36,699
in time so we're featuring time is one

290
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,009
of the 50 best websites of 2007 this is

291
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:41,350
18 months after you start working on

292
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,180
Weebly a year and a half after we

293
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,769
started working on Weebly and things

294
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,149
still aren't taking off there's no

295
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,889
hockey stick here things are actually

296
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,870
going in the wrong direction now I want

297
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,790
to try something out here raise your

298
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,470
hand if you're currently working on a

299
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,850
startup

300
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,740
okay now keep

301
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,110
hand up nope nope cute keep your hands

302
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,870
up now keep your hand up only if you've

303
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,259
been working on for over 18 months okay

304
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,060
right that's what I thought it's a long

305
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:09,220
time this is a really long time and we

306
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,600
didn't have any we didn't have too much

307
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,399
positive we were just sort of naive we

308
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,170
were naively hopeful that things were

309
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,699
working out and we knew it was a good

310
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,589
problem to be solving we're getting

311
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:20,920
feedback from our users but you know the

312
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:23,019
metrics weren't entirely there yet and

313
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,139
this is where it changes this is this is

314
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,970
20 months and finally finally 20 months

315
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:31,509
after we start working on we were seeing

316
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,880
our first real traction now this is good

317
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,440
this is where your your rate of

318
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,060
acquiring news per day is increasing

319
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,370
linearly that's a pretty good thing and

320
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,779
one thing to notice you know you you

321
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,370
might think hey if only I get on

322
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,079
TechCrunch I'll blow up you know my

323
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,149
company will be successful if I just get

324
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,240
on TechCrunch well look all the way back

325
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,430
there just via word-of-mouth now we are

326
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,170
now getting more users every single day

327
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:59,079
than if we were featured in newsweek

328
00:11:53,170 --> 00:12:01,060
time or TechCrunch in july 2008 we moved

329
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,019
in our first rail office 29 months after

330
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,600
you start working on we leave funny

331
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:06,339
story that TV on the wall got stolen our

332
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,029
office got broken into the first week we

333
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,470
moved in that was fun

334
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,899
getting a call from the police officer

335
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:17,680
at the next day bein like you gotta come

336
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,899
deal with your office is busted so you

337
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,060
know here's another picture and this is

338
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,259
this was just it was small it was 1400

339
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,220
square feet we ended up fitting I think

340
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:28,569
about 12 people there and and you know

341
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,130
around the summer time we started

342
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:32,079
looking at our bank account balance and

343
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,550
and you know we're like okay well you

344
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,589
know how much runway do we have this is

345
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,269
an important thing to know if you're not

346
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,009
profitable how much runway do we have we

347
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,480
said okay well well we really need to

348
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,399
start raising money in September

349
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,720
you know maybe October in November we're

350
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,550
gonna run out of money it's you know so

351
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,930
so we said well what the hell let's

352
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,949
let's give it a shot at least start

353
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,600
making some money so July 2008 when we

354
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:55,209
choose Weebly Pro we also sell domain

355
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,130
names now and when we start at that time

356
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,860
and you know things were looking good

357
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,680
but if you know anything about the fall

358
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,050
of 2008 it was just a really bad time to

359
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,180
be raising money so we went out there

360
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,280
and you know might have worked but

361
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,120
the terms were just not what we are

362
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,740
looking for so this is a graph of our

363
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,540
company bank account balance I actually

364
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,460
hacked up Vanguard's graphic you know

365
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,920
like flash graph to plot an XML feed to

366
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,540
graph this for you guys this is 34

367
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,040
months after we started working on

368
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,390
Weebly and it was pretty low and and and

369
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,870
this is you know this is this is another

370
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,980
hard time we basically we we looked at

371
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,710
our bank account balance and we said

372
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,670
okay well you know revenue is increasing

373
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,170
and things are going in the right

374
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,960
direction then we're pretty hopeful we

375
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,990
could squeeze through but you know but

376
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,550
we can't pay our bills next month so

377
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,320
we're we gonna do about it so you know

378
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,480
obviously payroll was just never an

379
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,040
option we're obviously gonna pay payroll

380
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,300
if we had to cut our own salaries that

381
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,500
was gonna be one thing but for people

382
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,120
with employed that was just not an

383
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,290
option not to pay that so the next step

384
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,610
was to get out of calendar literally I

385
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,650
remember getting out a big calendar on a

386
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,200
piece of paper and mapping out all our

387
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,790
bills on which days they were due and

388
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,350
how much money we thought we were gonna

389
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,930
make in the meantime to just barely

390
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,160
squeaked by and and then there was

391
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,900
really two types of bills that we

392
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,720
labeled there was one there was a type

393
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,850
of bill that if you didn't pay it you

394
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,020
got a late fee and the second type of

395
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,630
bill if you didn't pay it they shot your

396
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,000
servers off so obviously we had to pay

397
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,920
that second category but you know in

398
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,020
January 2009 which is which is a great

399
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,060
month for us you know we finally hit

400
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,710
break-even now this is where things

401
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,590
started turning in the in the profitable

402
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,300
direction and you know this is where you

403
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,600
first start seeing a working business

404
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,070
model it finally clicks and you can see

405
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,620
a little bit of history out there 35

406
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,210
months that's three years after we

407
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,760
started working on it we finally hit a

408
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,770
working business model this is February

409
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,300
2010 and now things are looking great

410
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,750
now we're off to the races this is four

411
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,010
years after we started working on Weebly

412
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,630
and I want you to notice all the way in

413
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,430
the back that that Newsweek that time

414
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,110
you know the TechCrunch articles they're

415
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,840
just blips on the radar you know now

416
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,090
every day we're getting about 5,000 new

417
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,690
users per day all of the award math it's

418
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,360
all organic growth in March 2011

419
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,180
sixty-one months after we started we

420
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,920
partnered with Sequoia Capital we love

421
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,630
them as partners and brought them on

422
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,120
board to help grow the business

423
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,440
and that brings us to today so where are

424
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,140
we now

425
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,399
today we bleep our is about 2% of the

426
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,089
active web sites on the internet that's

427
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:33,760
all based on public data from net craft

428
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:37,180
every month 15% of the United States

429
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,890
visits a Weebly website and my favorite

430
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,709
stat here is our Net Promoter Score our

431
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,910
Net Promoter Score is over 80% now if

432
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,769
you're not familiar with what a net

433
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,050
promoter score is that's you know that

434
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:49,149
means 88% of people who answered this

435
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,130
survey said 9 or 10 likely they're gonna

436
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,230
recommend we do a friend as a point of

437
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,029
comparison I think apples is 67% that's

438
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,579
considered excellent this explains

439
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,750
everything about our business a quick

440
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:02,019
tour of the office here moved in this

441
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,269
office about a year ago this is what it

442
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:06,579
looks like when you walk in this is this

443
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:08,709
a quick snapshot of our lobby and

444
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,959
conference room at the front here's our

445
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,190
open work plan area and you know we

446
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,360
really like this because you could

447
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,709
really talk and communicate but

448
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,630
obviously it gets noisy so one of the

449
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,380
things that we give everyone who works

450
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,730
at Weebly as bose noise-canceling

451
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,260
headphones to block out the noise it's a

452
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,940
TV room great for catching a big game

453
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,329
especially the Giants games have been on

454
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,610
lately and this is this is our kind of

455
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,410
you know kitchen slash rec area

456
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,019
downstairs we get super competitive on

457
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,310
ping-pong pool foosball one thing I want

458
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,890
you to notice is that bookshelf in the

459
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,320
back actually if you go up to that and

460
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,910
you know the right book to pull it

461
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,970
actually opens up I'm not sure how well

462
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,399
you can see that but it's it's its

463
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,690
policy we can't show anyone pictures of

464
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,310
inside the secret room unless you come

465
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,100
visit so we'd love to have you over to

466
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,660
check that out

467
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,980
so you know just for shits and giggles I

468
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,990
pulled our bank account balance from

469
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,699
this morning that's what our company

470
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,410
thank you balance looks like now and

471
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:04,809
this is 80 months after we started

472
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,160
working on Weebly I think the important

473
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,919
message here is it's still an unfinished

474
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,209
story you know I mean as large as we've

475
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,579
been able to grow this is just the

476
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:16,030
beginning so you know what's next for

477
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,980
Weebly well six years ago we thought the

478
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,319
same thing you know making a site it's

479
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,589
just hard you know and today people are

480
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,510
just as frustrated you know just as

481
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,010
confused and all they really want to do

482
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,559
is participate in the Internet and you

483
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,510
know what most people can't participate

484
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,480
in the internet the way they'd like to

485
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,040
you know people just want to you know

486
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,500
showcase their business showcase their

487
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,060
art or their talents and sell things

488
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,740
online and it's still too difficult for

489
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,270
them so you know as much as we've done

490
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,160
the last six years we think we've just

491
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,900
built a foundation and what's most

492
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,400
exciting is is what we're building it

493
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,130
right now and there's just a whole lot

494
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,100
of work left to do so I think the number

495
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,160
one takeaway of everything is you can't

496
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,050
succeed if you quit too often I've seen

497
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,810
people that build something for six

498
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,820
months and then they launch it and then

499
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:07,030
two months later they stop working on it

500
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,500
like how do you expect that to work you

501
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,270
know behind every I think we've seen

502
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,030
today behind every quote-unquote

503
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,680
overnight success you see people who

504
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,460
have been working for years and years

505
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:21,430
and years and if you want to build a

506
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,750
truly big and meaningful company it's

507
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,390
gonna take you seven to ten years of

508
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,130
your life you know don't give up so

509
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,900
easily you just gotta keep going

510
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,210
even at the early days for everyone

511
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,710
including us it didn't look great you

512
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,210
just have to push through and know that

513
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,630
you're working on a valuable problem and

514
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,250
keep pushing through so lastly I'll

515
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,650
close with it you know if you'd like to

516
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,860
help us finish the story that that's

517
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:46,090

518
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,140

519
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,940
