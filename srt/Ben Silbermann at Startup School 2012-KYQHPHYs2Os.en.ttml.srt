1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,959
well first thanks a lot for having me

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,609
it's really exciting for me to be here

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,940
in front of like so many people that all

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,920
want to build cool things I was I was

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,300
getting ready for the talk last night

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,590
and I was going back through old emails

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,800
because times are memories little bit

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,350
hazy and I found an email from March

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
2010 which was roughly like three and a

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,710
half four months after we launched

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Pinterest and it's an email to our

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,680
advisors and our investors at the time

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,359
and I thought I would read it to you

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,869
because I was kind of like a cool blast

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,130
from the past for me he mo says hey

16
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,649
everyone I wanted to provide a quick

17
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,140
update from cold brew labs which was our

18
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,210
company name just to review we launched

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,500
a website called Pinterest it's a tool

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,360
for people to share and discover the

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,710
things they love people join Pinterest

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,960
to create these collections or pin

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,000
boards in to follow collections created

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,010
by their friends we're happy to say that

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,829
we're making good progress today we have

26
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,980
almost 3,000 registered users and our

27
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,629
daily pin count is steadily increasing

28
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,969
I'm also happy to say that we've made

29
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,829
big operational improvements we're

30
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,439
relocating our offices to a new building

31
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,820
just a few blocks away the price will

32
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,400
decrease as we're sharing it with

33
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,130
another Y Combinator startup er do and

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,150
we've also gotten some free Amazon

35
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,150
hosting credits

36
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:20,050
so

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,350
a couple funny things about the email in

38
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,650
general the first is that the new

39
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,760
location in question is a dilapidated

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,860
two-bedroom apartment on California

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,680
Avenue and in fact when I told Jessica

42
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,390
Livingston that we were moving there she

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,760
said oh my god I thought that place was

44
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:42,910
a brothel and the second is the exact

45
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,340
setup of the place so we add two

46
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,230
bedrooms one of which my co-founder Paul

47
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,810
lived in in one of which Dave the

48
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,540
co-founder of giardia lived in this is a

49
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,130
picture of Dave and we worked out of the

50
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,960
living room these two companies all

51
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,240
together pretty much all day and Dave

52
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,610
was a late night guy who's hackers

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,510
hacker always up till 4:00 a.m. and so

54
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,790
when we were having meetings with

55
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,530
investors or with users every once in a

56
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,850
while Dave what kind of saunter out in

57
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,470
his towel because that was how you had

58
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,810
to get to the shower and just sort of

59
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,190
wave it everyone and it was really

60
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,660
awkward and so a little bit later when

61
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,370
we all got to go watch the social

62
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,310
network we made a pact that if anyone

63
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,870
ever made a movie about our company they

64
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:31,110
would get to be played by Ryan Gosling

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,980
because Ryan Gosling has awesome ABS so

66
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,150
the other thing though that's like a

67
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,700
little bit more serious if you think

68
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,350
about it for months in 3000 accounts for

69
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,790
consumer start up is really not very

70
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,130
good and I think the thing that

71
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,840
surprised me the most in starting a

72
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,269
company after reading about you know

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,800
Facebook hits Harvard 95% penetration in

74
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,230
two weeks like Instagram shoots to a

75
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,260
million people is that it can take a

76
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,810
really really long time to build things

77
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,940
that are worthwhile so March 2010 we

78
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,220
launched Pinterest where 3,000 accounts

79
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,230
and that wouldn't be so bad if we hadn't

80
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,500
started building Pinterest actually in

81
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,570
November 2009 and that alone wouldn't

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,030
have been so bad if I hadn't left my job

83
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,030
to start a company in May 2008

84
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,020
a lot of people say things like running

85
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,820
a startup is like running a marathon and

86
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,590
I think that the part of the analogy

87
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,150
that's right is that it's long but it's

88
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,530
actually really different I mean I think

89
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,720
when I think about my experience it's

90
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,550
more like going on a road trip like in a

91
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,620
car that doesn't have good headlights

92
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,060
and you don't have very much gas and you

93
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,320
think you're going to Toledo but you

94
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,120
find out you're supposed to be in Miami

95
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,680
and if you really run out of gas you

96
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,730
might have to buy gas for someone that

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,550
might just kick you out of your own

98
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,530
drivers seat and that uncertainty the

99
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,630
fact that every single day you're

100
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,670
dealing with a lot of choices you don't

101
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,290
have a lot of perfect information is for

102
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,120
me that's lesson that was hardest to

103
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,459
learn and continues to be real challenge

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,930
in doing it startup today so I'm going

105
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,310
to talk a little bit about kind of our

106
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,840
journey through this kind of weird

107
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,670
process and a few of the things that we

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,940
learned along the way number one lesson

109
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,830
making things can take a long time so

110
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,420
2008 I was working at Google and I was

111
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,370
in Adsense not as an engineer but

112
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,989
working basically doing customer support

113
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,290
taking feedback from users and feeding

114
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,370
it back into the advertising products

115
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,229
the reason I was there was because I'd

116
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,660
come from Washington DC where I was

117
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:21,010
working as a consultant and growing up

118
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,570
even though I always looked up to

119
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,490
anybody that made things whether it was

120
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,840
an architect or an engineer or an artist

121
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,520
I'd always kind of thought that I was

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,870
going to be a doctor and so I pursued

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,729
that path which is the same path my

124
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,640
parents pursued the same path that both

125
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,930
my sisters pursued so when I graduated

126
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,370
from college and decided I didn't want

127
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,190
to be a doctor I was a little bit lost

128
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,300
but even then like even at the time that

129
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,490
I thought I was going to be a doctor I

130
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,440
had this real interest in technology I

131
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,450
thought it was really cool so when I was

132
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,830
an undergrad I made a program with some

133
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,960
friends and let you try on glasses

134
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,600
online and it was appropriate because

135
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,640
both my parents were ophthalmologists

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,410
when I was at my consulting job in DC a

137
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,790
good friend of mine named alt I had me

138
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,410
help him out with his wife see startup

139
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,540
what he was trying to help market bands

140
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,400
he was a musician in a band and even

141
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,560
when I moved out to California I was at

142
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,930
Google I was working on another website

143
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,370
which was a quiz website to let anybody

144
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,370
play quiz questions about anything they

145
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,560
wanted and the common theme through all

146
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,240
these things was that for some reason I

147
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
kept going back to the idea of building

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,330
a product I thought that was a really

149
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,760
exciting thing to do but it always

150
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,390
stalled and I always had an excuse for

151
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,740
why it stalled it wasn't the right mark

152
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,500
I need to learn more by working at

153
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,870
Google it wasn't the right timing but

154
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,260
actually the dependent variable was just

155
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,670
me

156
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,860
all right the dependent variable was

157
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,930
that I never actually committed and put

158
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,920
myself in a situation where I had to

159
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,660
make it work and so I think for me I

160
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,370
paid too much attention to talks where

161
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,870
people basically build something huge on

162
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,000
the side and they were pulled out of

163
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,310
their job and everything was working for

164
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,230
me at least the act of committing to

165
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,600
going out and doing doing it turned out

166
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,740
to be a really important thing and so I

167
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,300
don't know if this applies to everyone

168
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,620
I've heard of a lot of people that have

169
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,510
successfully built things on the side

170
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,910
and then gently transition it into a

171
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,130
full-time gig but at least in my

172
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,870
situation for a person that really like

173
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,630
puts his heart into whatever job is at

174
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,000
hand it was a really important step I

175
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,600
actually remember the night that I made

176
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,670
the call

177
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,920
I was sitting at dinner with my

178
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,420
girlfriend then now my wife and I was

179
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,590
talking about some cool idea that I

180
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,750
think would be great how we could build

181
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,610
it how we could market it and she looked

182
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,770
at me and said you know you should

183
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,550
either do it or just just stop talking

184
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,310
about it

185
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,870
and it was a little bit harsh but

186
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,979
honestly it was the best thing someone

187
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,139
could have told me because she was

188
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,610
absolutely right and I feel genuinely

189
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,039
thankful that someone was honest enough

190
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,870
in my life to just call me out and say

191
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,430
make it happen or don't make it happen

192
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,990
but just make your call and be happy

193
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,860
with that call and so I'm always really

194
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,440
thankful for her getting me that advice

195
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,000
so I left in 2008 and I hooked up with

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,199
one of my friends named Paul he was a

197
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,210
great friend from college

198
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,470
super driven guy and we decided the

199
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,509
thing we were really interested in was

200
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,130
mobile so the iPhone had come out

201
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,389
recently in the platform had come out

202
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,720
and so people were really excited about

203
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,130
it

204
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,500
and the product that we wanted to build

205
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,750
was called tote it was a shopping

206
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,979
catalogue on the phone and the reason I

207
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,120
thought this would be so cool was that I

208
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,590
got all these catalogs in the mail

209
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,690
dumped on my doorstep and I had this

210
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,639
brand-new like really cool phone and I

211
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,979
just wanted to see something running on

212
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,539
this phone and so we got to work and we

213
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,810
started prototyping it we did it out of

214
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,449
savings but there were some problems the

215
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,460
first was that it took a really long

216
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,289
time to get things built and approved by

217
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,030
Apple like a really long time back then

218
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,259
you had no idea when I was going to get

219
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,090
approved you had no idea what's gonna

220
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,639
happen and second there were a lot of

221
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,229
unsolved problems back then we had sort

222
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,180
of these grand ideas of doing all sorts

223
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,530
of offline caching being able to use

224
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,479
this thing in the subway being able to

225
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,370
eventually process payments we put all

226
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,139
those ideas into this prototype and it

227
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,630
made it really hard to ship and not

228
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,039
surprisingly sooner or later we were in

229
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,800
a situation where we really needed to

230
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,870
raise some money and it was 2008 and you

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,259
had two non technical co-founders and it

232
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,419
was a really bleak time there are lots

233
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,849
of ways for investors to say no to you

234
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,880
and I'm pretty sure that I've heard all

235
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:08,639
of them like I've heard every single one

236
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,289
like these are the top three like number

237
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,729
one is call me back in a few months this

238
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,930
is kind of the most painful it's just

239
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,560
like you ask someone out on a date and

240
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,810
they're like not right now but maybe

241
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,669
maybe in November right that one that

242
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,719
one is like really really hard to hear

243
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,250
because you're gonna have even less

244
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,680
money and you can even have less

245
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,240
leverage in a negotiation the second is

246
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,620
who else is in alright this is one that

247
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,669
you hear all the time it's like it's not

248
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,469
good enough for me

249
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,880
by myself but if there are other people

250
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,500
to come money I'd be willing to consider

251
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,820
it and then there were the occasional

252
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,979
people that were really blunt they were

253
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,769
just like there's no way this is going

254
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,659
to happen this is

255
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,449
this is insane it's totally crazy I

256
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,100
remember really vividly I went to a

257
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:46,749
session where I was pitching actually a

258
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,519
whole group of investors up on Silicon

259
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,600
Valley and it's really intimidating

260
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,489
right you're looking and these people

261
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,050
that build great companies and I'm about

262
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,519
five minutes into explaining what we're

263
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,889
doing everyone starts just like heading

264
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,470
for the door and I was like man like

265
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:02,139
what what am I doing wrong

266
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,679
and I found out they had brought a tray

267
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:07,329
of free cookies and what I was saying

268
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,129
was interesting enough to keep them in

269
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:12,730
their seats as long as they were like no

270
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,170
cookies in the background you know we've

271
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,059
done fundraising a few times and

272
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,249
sometimes it's been easier and sometimes

273
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:20,379
it's been really really hard we've done

274
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,299
it where we've flown all the coasts

275
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,499
we've tracked down sort of everyone in

276
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,360
our alumni directory whether they were

277
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:27,129
tech investors are not investors we've

278
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,049
done it a bunch and I think I've learned

279
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:30,850
like three important lessons that I

280
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:32,290
think any entrepreneur should should

281
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,720
know if they're starting the kind of

282
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,860
company they think will need funding the

283
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,839
first is that my even rich people are

284
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,549
subject to free cookies right like even

285
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,649
even though you're really rich you're

286
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:48,249
probably still the kind of person that

287
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,360
is influenced by free and and in that

288
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:50,860
lesson is actually something really

289
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
important it's that investors are just

290
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,829
people - right

291
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
investors are just regular people that

292
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,379
happen to other people's money or their

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,850
own money that are willing to put

294
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,069
forward and even though they have a

295
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,869
really good opinion on things they might

296
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,279
be wrong and that was something that was

297
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,980
really hard for me to swallow because I

298
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,379
really looked up to all these people

299
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,360
you know the second lesson is that if

300
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,829
you really need money and they have

301
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,749
money and they know they're the only

302
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,740
person that can give you the money you

303
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:16,600
don't really have any leverage

304
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,119
whatsoever are you have zero leverage

305
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,589
and that puts you in a really tough spot

306
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,509
right you can't really negotiate it's

307
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,889
2008 they know it's 2008 they see your

308
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:25,749
app it's kind of crappy nobody really

309
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:28,569
uses it there's nothing you can do

310
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:30,399
unless you hack that system right unless

311
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,589
you somehow turn the tables and give

312
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,319
them a reason that you should have the

313
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,259
leverage and those reasons generally are

314
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:39,549
fear of losing the deal right or the

315
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:42,189
belief that this thing is just going to

316
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,660
be so big that whether you give the

317
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:45,700
money or not like you're just going to

318
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,800
be wildly successful

319
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,980
number two was a hard case for us to

320
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,560
sell so we solve for number one and that

321
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,690
was a really important thing and the

322
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,040
very last thing I learned and this was

323
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,210
something that was especially true when

324
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,410
you're kind of driving up Sand Hill Road

325
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,090
which I don't know if you guys have been

326
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,010
to I sort of thought I would look like

327
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,660
the Emerald City but it kind of looks

328
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,660
like a ski lodge with no mountain it's

329
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,890
just very like normal buildings the

330
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,850
final thing I learned is that people are

331
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,270
going to give you all kinds of advice

332
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,710
and I think that it's really easy to

333
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,120
take that advice because you walk into a

334
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,910
room and there's like Google's first

335
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,740
stock certificate and you know they're

336
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,410
like invented Yahoo like these people

337
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,880
are really really really smart but if

338
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,560
you look at the returns on venture

339
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,070
capital it's pretty shaky like we're in

340
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,120
a pretty high volatility industry and

341
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,530
one thing that we always told ourselves

342
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,200
and one thing that I really really

343
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:38,040
believe is that fundamentally like the

344
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,260
future is unwritten like if they knew

345
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,540
they would be done right and so people

346
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,920
can tell you that you should be more

347
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,090
technical they can tell you that you're

348
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,650
in the wrong market they can tell you

349
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,150
all of these things and those things

350
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,950
might be true and you should assess them

351
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,620
for yourself but you shouldn't take it

352
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,750
on face because they could be wrong and

353
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,640
in the back of your head you have to

354
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,020
remember something that for all the

355
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,460
millions of dollars venture capital

356
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,840
investors have made for all the

357
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,220
certificates that are on the wall they

358
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,010
are these little trophies when things go

359
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,140
IPO for all those things there are

360
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,910
things that they passed on and those are

361
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,890
the things that actually burn them up

362
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,690
like those are the ones that like haunt

363
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,460
them at night and I think that if you

364
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,410
can convince somebody that you just

365
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,990
might be the one that's going to beat

366
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,130
the odds you can be successful and it's

367
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,060
a general attitude that I think is

368
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,160
important whether you're recruiting

369
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,330
whether you're raising money whether you

370
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,910
just need to make a final push in

371
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,410
adjusting your product so eventually we

372
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,760
put money together and we were working

373
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,110
back on toe we were still having the

374
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,670
same fundamental problem that we

375
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,020
couldn't iterate and improve fast enough

376
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,580
and we were fundraising on the East

377
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,940
Coast and while I was out there I met

378
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,220
this really great guy named Evan sharp

379
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,630
Evan is a Columbia graduate student at

380
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,120
the time he's studying architecture and

381
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,440
we just hit it off and Evan and Paul and

382
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,020
I are commiserating about this whole

383
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,730
dilemma and we're just thinking about

384
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,290
what would be cool to build like what do

385
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,430
we just want to see and really what we

386
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,020
wanted to see was we wanted to see

387
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,080
something out there in the world we just

388
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,820
wanted to see somebody using something

389
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,589
somebody asked me once like what's my

390
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,180
what's my big plan like what would make

391
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:04,709
me really happy when we were starting

392
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,209
Pinterest I was like geez I just want to

393
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,279
go somewhere and see somebody that I

394
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:10,410
don't know using something that I made

395
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,790
and have it be kind of useful like that

396
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,010
is what I thought was really exciting

397
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,810
and so we came up with this idea for

398
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,310
something that was web-based really

399
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,550
simple something that we would use

400
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,529
personally and that was Pinterest we

401
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,060
learned a lesson from doing the iPhone

402
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,470
app and it was that even though we had

403
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,300
all these ideas of all these great

404
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,550
features that were cramming in we

405
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,260
weren't great at one thing right there

406
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,660
wasn't one thing that was special about

407
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,940
it people talk a lot about like a

408
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,920
Minimum Viable Product or when you

409
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,329
should ship something and my advice is

410
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,100
you should ship when you have one thing

411
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,959
that you're proud of like one thing that

412
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,640
is worthy of someone's time and that

413
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,320
could take you a long time and it could

414
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,790
take you not very long at all but if

415
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,690
it's not worth their time to check out

416
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,310
you're not going to get any good

417
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,420
feedback on whether it's good or not

418
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,610
they're going to see it they're going to

419
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,579
be like this is crap thank you for the

420
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,899
feedback start again and we decided that

421
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,220
the one thing we had to do really well

422
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,630
if we were going to make a website about

423
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,700
collections we had to make it look

424
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,050
really cool like if it didn't look cool

425
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,310
but no one's going to make a collection

426
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,420
because they don't want to show their

427
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,880
friends because this thing they just

428
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,170
made looks really lame so this is the

429
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
first version of Pinterest it didn't

430
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,980
look very cool and November 2009 we

431
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,390
started building the basic

432
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,339
infrastructure and started really

433
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,779
iterating on what it could look like how

434
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,480
could we make it look really interesting

435
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:24,029
so we went through a lot of versions of

436
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,760
this vertical grid horizontal grid both

437
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,100
left side nav right side nav top nav

438
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,690
different logos and we waited until we

439
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,579
felt we had something that we thought

440
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,290
was really cool and we would show it to

441
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,339
people along the way we would show them

442
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,200
something that we thought was a little

443
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,760
bit of an improvement and we finally

444
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,649
felt ready to launch it I emailed out to

445
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,910
all my friends like all my family I'm

446
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,620
like look at this really cool thing

447
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:48,240
we're really jazzed about it and

448
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,510
basically no one responded right there's

449
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,730
basically no response at all 3,000

450
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,019
accounts not active users account is

451
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,329
pretty bad if you have three people

452
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,940
actively pushing it out to every single

453
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,459
person they know every day for four

454
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,110
months but there was something that was

455
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,500
really positive and it was that the few

456
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,840
people that used it myself amongst them

457
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,090
actually really loved it

458
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,710
and instead of immediately changing the

459
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,290
product I was like maybe I can just find

460
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,550
more people like me and that also fits

461
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,480
with our current operating strategy

462
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,820
since we don't have very good

463
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,380
engineering resources so we're just

464
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,900
going to market this thing and that's

465
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,640
what we started to do we started to have

466
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,650
meetups to serve first meetup in San

467
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,230
Francisco it was at a store called rare

468
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,790
device we did another meet up later at

469
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,160
West Elm it's a little bit later we all

470
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,440
try to make it fun do fun pictures and

471
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,940
we also market it online so we had a

472
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,440
campaign with a blogger that I had met

473
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,089
named Victoria who's a wonderful woman

474
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,040
and we had something called pin it

475
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,480
forward where everyone would create a

476
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,830
pinboard about what home meant to them

477
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,630
it was organized like a chain letter

478
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,130
like one person would introduce the next

479
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,720
person would introduce the next person

480
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,270
and everyone who participated would get

481
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,980
invites to invite other people and the

482
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,630
thing about it that really worked was we

483
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,910
found this little group of people that

484
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,170
were interested in the same thing and we

485
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,990
showed them how the service could be

486
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,640
helpful to them and fundamentally that's

487
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,080
what Pinterest is about it's about

488
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,970
finding people who share common

489
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,580
interests and those people may be your

490
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,440
friends they may not be your friends but

491
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,940
we needed a different strategy for going

492
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,530
at it than all the strategies that we

493
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,270
were reading about in terms of general

494
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,580
social sites so it's a really really

495
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,770
exciting moment for us and the best

496
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,680
moment of all was when things started to

497
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,510
grow when we went to that Meetup even

498
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,760
though we had very very few users I

499
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,320
distinctly remember the people hadn't

500
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,970
met each other before we're having real

501
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,530
conversations right they weren't

502
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,880
conversations they were asking

503
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,410
about things in their life that they

504
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000
never would have known if they were just

505
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,900
following each other on Twitter or if

506
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,970
they were just looking at each other's

507
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,200
Facebook projects they found people they

508
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,640
were saying hey how's the gardening

509
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,080
project that you're working on how's

510
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,839
your new living room how's all that

511
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,220
stuff going and it felt like that was

512
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,020
the kernel of something really special

513
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,120
the idea that you could use a service

514
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,100
online that you found out about you

515
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,600
could go to a physical place and you

516
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,600
could find that same person and you had

517
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,640
a genuine connection a lot of people in

518
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,110
Silicon Valley didn't get and I still

519
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,459
don't know if they really get Pinterest

520
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,770
a lot of them kind of looked at it they

521
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,569
said well it's visual it's not organized

522
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,880
in real-time which was a big theme back

523
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,679
then it doesn't have a feed like it

524
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,959
didn't really make sense to them why

525
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,000
anyone would use it but the fact that it

526
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,920
made sense to someone was what really

527
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,890
mattered to me and I think it ties back

528
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,010
to what I told you guys about

529
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,500
investors a lot of people are reading

530
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,000
tech press investors read the same

531
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,740
hacker news articles that everyone reads

532
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,900
there's not some secret special hacker

533
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,940
news that has the real companies that

534
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,740
you want to invest in they're reading

535
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,840
the same TechCrunch articles they're

536
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,520
getting the same data it's incredibly

537
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,320
democratic you have access to all the

538
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,300
information they have access to and that

539
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,130
also means that just like anyone else

540
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,350
they may be subject to the same biases

541
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,170
and trends and bubbles and reports that

542
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,750
happen in the general consumer media at

543
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,900
the time we were like the polar opposite

544
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,820
of what people wanted to see Twitter

545
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,500
FriendFeed Facebook were the hot

546
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,490
companies right because they were

547
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,170
real-time

548
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,180
Google was like we need to do real-time

549
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,800
search everything had to be a text-based

550
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,360
feed that could be accessed on your

551
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,180
phone and here we come and we're saying

552
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,530
it's not real-time it's all visual and

553
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,380
so if they're drawing they're 2 by 2

554
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,910
matrix they're like this is a disaster

555
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,850
right this is like the worst thing that

556
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:21,430
could happen and eventually what we can

557
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,230
tell them eventually is we would show

558
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,940
them real users and eventually those

559
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,050
users were their wives or eventually

560
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,550
their users were people they knew when

561
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,230
there were life and that's when it

562
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:34,150
became a lot easier to get things done

563
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,740
so where are we today we live in San

564
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,420
Francisco now we just moved her office

565
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,610
from Palo Alto sadly I love Palo Alto

566
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,950
and we're building out a team of people

567
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,930
that are really diverse I mean I think

568
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,880
the thing that we learned in building

569
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,500
the service was that our problem and

570
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,720
distribution was an engineering problem

571
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,400
it was a community problem the problem

572
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,020
in building the first really cool thing

573
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,910
didn't happen to be anything but a

574
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,430
design problem and those three things

575
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,800
just had to work together for our kind

576
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,050
of business to succeed when I came out

577
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,730
of Google I thought man the only way I

578
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,350
can get this done if I get the most

579
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,940
brilliant graduate student out of

580
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,740
Stanford who doesn't know that he's

581
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,940
invented PageRank yet get him into a

582
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,790
room and we'll just build all this

583
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,470
really really awesome stuff we call our

584
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,090
company called brew labs because all the

585
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,100
cool companies call themselves labs

586
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,750
right we're like like oh my god we got

587
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,700
to be labs or no one is going to want to

588
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,970
work here it's like labs companies are

589
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,370
really cool and one of the most kind of

590
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,780
satisfying realizations is that there

591
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,190
are a lot of different ways to succeed

592
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,420
there are a lot of different companies

593
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,590
there are companies that don't raise

594
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,150
money they're companies that do raise

595
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,700
money they're companies that go b2b

596
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,660
their company

597
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,400
that our consumer and then within

598
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,080
consumer there are a lot of different

599
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,130
things that are successful for the very

600
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,300
simple reason that there are a lot of

601
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,610
different kinds of people in the world

602
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,980
and as much as people want to give you

603
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,900
advice about exactly how you should run

604
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,850
your startup exactly the strategy I

605
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,140
think you need to trust the data you

606
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,090
need to trust the users that you have

607
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,560
and you need to trust your own instinct

608
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,890
to do what you think is going to be

609
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,060
right for your company

610
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,890
Pinterest right now is a tool where we

611
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,140
help people find their inspiration into

612
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,940
some people that sounds really hokey but

613
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,290
to me the idea that we can show people

614
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,510
things that they want to do in their

615
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,710
future help them get closer to actually

616
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,450
doing those things whether it's

617
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,790
redecorating their home or going on a

618
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,700
vacation or buying a gift and in that

619
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,620
process inspire someone else is a really

620
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,030
cool thing to be working on and it's not

621
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,920
what we thought the site was going to do

622
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,660
when we first launched it but it's what

623
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,850
it's come to be and sometimes the

624
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,990
product finds its purpose and sometimes

625
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,910
it goes the other way around

626
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,260
and either way is okay as long as you

627
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,260
get to something that people really love

628
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,530
Pinterest is a network right we have

629
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,330
millions of people that are connected

630
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,890
through billions of objects it's the

631
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,810
third largest source of referral traffic

632
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,100
on the internet and so in the early days

633
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,860
when people like we don't need to be a

634
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,660
technology company now we have to write

635
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,340
all of a sudden now we need folks that

636
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,170
can mine for data and those people have

637
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,460
really interesting things to do like

638
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,780
we're on that road trip like we're

639
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,910
heading towards the Midwest and turns

640
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,530
out we had to view the other way and I

641
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,190
think that adaptability to change is

642
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,330
really fundamental and at the same time

643
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,680
Pinterest is a tool where people can do

644
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,480
these things right you can plan a

645
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,280
vacation you can plan cooking and

646
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,530
recipes you can plan holiday shopping

647
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,930
you can plan all these things in your

648
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,580
life and the very last thing that's

649
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,090
important to me is that Pinterest is a

650
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,290
team of talented people like I feel

651
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,910
genuinely lucky like walk into the

652
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,590
office and work with people that are

653
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:25,190
better than me at pretty much everything

654
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,330
I do and I think that to me even though

655
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,880
there are a lot of stories told about

656
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,410
entrepreneurs the toil alone the best

657
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,540
things in the world are made by groups

658
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,610
of people I think when you're really

659
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,500
early on startup you're really worried

660
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,910
about oh my gosh like I can't give my

661
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,810
equity to this person it's going to run

662
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:43,880
out but it's that size of the total pie

663
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,190
right it's it's the size of how many

664
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,660
people can you actually build something

665
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,590
that's bigger than who they are and if

666
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,150
you can find those

667
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,289
people if you can find people that want

668
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,270
to work with you on something that's

669
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,039
bigger than they are I think that it's

670
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,929
the best investment that you can make to

671
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,760
give them ownership in what you're

672
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,740
actually building and to me it's just

673
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,850
been a really gratifying experience to

674
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,830
know that everyone that works with us

675
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:07,309
actually owns part of the fate of the

676
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:10,130
company so this is just people from

677
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,299
around the office we obviously value

678
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,240
collaboration it's kind of how the

679
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,919
company was founded and so if I had two

680
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,320
pieces of advice there they're really

681
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,520
really simple right the first is that

682
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,659
you should really just build something

683
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,700
you believe in if you're going to go on

684
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,529
a five-year seven-year 10-year 15 year

685
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,270
journey at least build something that

686
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:27,740
you really really love because otherwise

687
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,179
you're definitely going to burn out

688
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,730
right you'd have to be like the most

689
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:33,409
mercenary person to give themselves 15

690
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,299
years and take all this risk if you

691
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:37,820
didn't at least love the idea of where

692
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,250
you're going to end up and the second is

693
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,159
just don't give up don't let somebody

694
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,809
talk you out of your dream and the

695
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,000
reason that I think startup school is so

696
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,070
cool is because if you look around in

697
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,230
the room like you're surrounded by all

698
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,120
these people that really want to do what

699
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,049
you're doing

700
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,940
Silicon Valley is like a weird place

701
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,470
like people always seem to be talking

702
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,610
about doing startups but people are from

703
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,500
all over the country they're from all

704
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,360
over the world and those early parts of

705
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,100
doing a start-up can actually be really

706
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,200
lonely can just be a total bummer

707
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,370
because you're toiling on this thing no

708
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,890
one cares about it it's not getting

709
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,419
anywhere and there's a tendency I think

710
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,919
with a lot of people that I meet are

711
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,140
doing startups that are like I just need

712
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,120
to work harder I need to go out into the

713
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,039
world less I need to turn on a life less

714
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,950
frequently maybe I need to sit closer to

715
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,899
the screen and I think that it's a

716
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,549
really dangerous game to play like

717
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,169
there's a reason that I started the

718
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,240
presentation by showing a really good

719
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:31,399
friend of mine who wasn't working at the

720
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,929
company I was but was still hanging out

721
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:35,390
with us all the time the fact that we

722
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,820
could get a beer and talk about hey this

723
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,860
is really tough this is a hard time made

724
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,899
it a lot easier and wherever you live

725
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,340
the great thing now is that you can find

726
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:45,409
those people like they may be in your

727
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,549
neighborhoods they may be online they

728
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:48,049
may be some part of a meet-up

729
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:49,789
but you can find those people somewhere

730
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,320
and I personally think it's good advice

731
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,570
to take the time and to invest in those

732
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,549
people so part of the reason I was so

733
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,980
excited to come was to me it's just

734
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:00,020
really exciting to be in a room full of

735
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,060
so many people to basically want to do

736
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,710
what I want to do right

737
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,960
I basically just want to build something

738
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,540
bigger than myself that a lot of people

739
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,670
in the world will find useful and to be

740
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,830
with lots of those people just makes me

741
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:15,430
happy it gets me excited about doing

742
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,430
what we do every day
