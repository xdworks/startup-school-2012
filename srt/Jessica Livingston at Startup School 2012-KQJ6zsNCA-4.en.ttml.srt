1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
hi everyone this is so big league this

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,460
year I can't believe it we have like

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,519
this team of people in the back helping

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,429
there's real chairs and look how many

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,350
seats there are this is so exciting

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,470
I'm Jessica Livingston I'm one of the

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,300
founders of Y Combinator and it's been

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,109
more than seven years since we started

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,500
YC and in that time we've funded four

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:34,950
hundred and sixty-seven startups so I've

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,300
seen a lot of patterns Thank You us I

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,760
was a little nervous back there so

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,460
thanks there's a talk I always want to

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,140
give at the beginning of each batch

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,180
warning everyone about stuff that I know

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,370
is probably gonna happen to them I

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,350
finally wrote down my thoughts and I'm

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,030
gonna share it with you today so we all

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,940
know that lots of smart and talented

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,309
people start startups on the left side

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,890
there you see huge numbers of startups

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,439
getting started and yet if you look at

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,780
the other side a few years later there's

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,270
actually only a handful of startups that

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,159
are big successes what's happening in

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,200
the middle there that's causing such

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,509
failure it's like there's a tunnel full

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,790
of monsters that kill them along the way

29
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,670
and I just want to thank minnow monsters

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,619
for providing me these fabulous cartoon

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,350
monsters so I'm going to tell you about

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,850
these monsters today so you can know how

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,460
to avoid them in general your best

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,619
weapon against these monsters is

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,790
determination and even though we usually

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,950
use one word for it

37
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,170
determination is really two separate

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,490
things its resilience and Drive

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,979
resilience keeps you from being pushed

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,780
backwards and drive makes you go

41
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,579
forwards one reason you need resilience

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,189
in a start-up is that you're gonna get

43
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,320
rejected a lot even the most famous

44
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,649
startups had a surprising amount of

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,509
rejection early on everyone you

46
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,640
encounter will have doubts about what

47
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,099
you're doing whether its investors

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,890
potential employees reporters your

49
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,990
family and friends what you don't

50
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,870
you lies until you start a start-up is

51
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,970
how much external validation you've

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,100
gotten for the conservative choices

53
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,590
you've made in the past you go to

54
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,569
college and everyone says great you

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,150
graduate and get a job at Google and

56
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,600
everyone says great well what do you

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,950
think happens when you quit your job to

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,020
start a company to rent out air beds

59
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,570
this is Airbnb x' website when they

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,970
first launched in 2007

61
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,459
I mean look up there where they explain

62
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,320
what they do it says to designers create

63
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,300
a new way to connect at the IDSA

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,060
conference I've never even heard of that

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,940
conference and over on the left it says

66
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,580
list your air bed it was only for air

67
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,340
beds I mean it's unbelievable this is

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,800
not the sort of thing that you get a lot

69
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,170
of external validation for almost

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,269
everyone is more impressed when you get

71
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,790
a job at Google then if you make a

72
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,900
website for people to rent out air beds

73
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,900
for conferences and yet this is one of

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,269
the most successful startups so even if

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,010
your air B&B you're gonna start out

76
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:28,140
looking like an egg blue Ugly Duckling

77
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:31,440
to most people here the air B&B founders

78
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,299
when they did YC back in early 2009 and

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,430
at this point they'd already endured

80
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,340
tons of rejection you should check out

81
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,030
Brian's talk from the 2010 startup

82
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,040
school it's a very inspirational story

83
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,870
but by the time they came to us they had

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,049
maxed out their credit cards they were

85
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,810
eating leftover Cap'n McCain cereal they

86
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,220
were at the end of their rope and

87
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,880
everyone thought their idea was crazy

88
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,870
even I actually did but they knew they

89
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,690
were on to something

90
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,750
and during YC they made some key changes

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,430
to their site they talked to users they

92
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,820
set their goals and they measured

93
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,329
everything and the graph started to go

94
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,670
up remember the new ideas usually seemed

95
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,549
crazy at first but if you have a good

96
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:22,049
idea and you execute well everyone will

97
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:24,120
see it eventually we funded Eric magic

98
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,370
offski about two years ago when he was

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,760
working on impulse the predecessor to

100
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,850
the Pebble watch

101
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,130
Eric was a single founder and these

102
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:37,440
watches there have something in common

103
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:39,970
the terrifies investors their hardware

104
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
poor Eric had a really hard time getting

105
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,770
funding no one wanted to fund the

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,170
hardware company he met with more than

107
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,110
like 30 investors who all said things

108
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,270
like I love the idea but I can't fund a

109
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,040
hardware company some claim they just

110
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,900
didn't fund hardware companies as a rule

111
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,780
others said that there are too many

112
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,450
capital expenses up front they all said

113
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,130
no when he showed them the concept but

114
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,050
he'd been building the pebble based on

115
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,390
all this user feedback from the impulse

116
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,820
and he felt strongly that people wanted

117
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,430
this product so I remember he talked to

118
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,520
Paul and they agreed he should just give

119
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:18,310
up investors and put it on Kickstarter

120
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,310
his original goal was to raise a hundred

121
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,410
thousand dollars to make a thousand

122
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,920
watches and instead of a hundred

123
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:31,150
thousand dollars pebble raised ten point

124
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,980
two million dollars in 30 days the

125
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:39,490
largest amount of money ever raised on

126
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:42,400
Kickstarter even Y Combinator got

127
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,950
rejected when we first started this here

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,580
is our first batch sitting at dinner in

129
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,510
Cambridge Massachusetts back in O five

130
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,420
now there are lots of organizations

131
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,370
doing what we do but trust me when we

132
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,550
first started people thought we were

133
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:01,510
crazy or just stupid even our own

134
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,910
lawyers tried to talk us out of it but

135
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,370
eight teams of founders took a chance on

136
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,350
Y Combinator and moved to Cambridge and

137
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,660
got there twelve thousand dollars per

138
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,810
team and I think they tell you they had

139
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,360
a really great experience we too knew we

140
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,460
were on to something interesting so we

141
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,370
focused on making something that a few

142
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,810
people loved and we just expanded slowly

143
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,400
from there but it was a slow process

144
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,770
when we came out to Silicon Valley in

145
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,020
the winter of oh-6 we hardly knew anyone

146
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,970
so we decided we'd focus on meeting new

147
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,630
investors to convince them to come to

148
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,390
demo day

149
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,350
I got an introduction to the number one

150
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,760
angel investor in the valley Ron Conway

151
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:48,010
and let me show you how he tried to

152
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,610
brush us off so we get the introduction

153
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:54,820
and Ron says is this in Boston I stick

154
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,040
to local and I said no we're in Mountain

155
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,030
View and we'd love to have you come to

156
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,250
demo day and he said so is this a chance

157
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,080
to invest in your incubator and I

158
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,210
replied no we're not asking you to

159
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,150
invest in us we were asking you to

160
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,220
invest in the individual startups and he

161
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,950
said off to circle back to you I'm

162
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,650
jammed up we got the jammed up right now

163
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:21,520
from Ron Conway was so embarrassing oh

164
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:25,090
my gosh but it all worked out in the end

165
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,420
here's Ron a year later speaking to the

166
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,070
winter o7 batch of founders he did wind

167
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,540
up coming to demo day and he was

168
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,260
impressed with what he saw

169
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,870
remember if you execute well eventually

170
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,180
you'll win people over and by the way I

171
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,640
should also point out that there's David

172
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,370
Rees anko who's speaking later today and

173
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,080
there's hard to gar who's now a partner

174
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:52,090
at YC it was their batch remember there

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,480
were two components to determination

176
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,460
resilience and drive we've talked about

177
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,800
why you need resilience because everyone

178
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,020
will be down on you but you need Drive

179
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,510
to overcome the sheer variety of

180
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,390
problems you'll face in a startup some

181
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,330
of them are painfully specific like a

182
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:13,840
lawsuit or a deal blowing up and some

183
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,940
are demoralizing ly vague like no one's

184
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,610
visiting your site and you can't figure

185
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,950
out why there's no playbook you can

186
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,919
consult when these problems come up you

187
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:27,510
have to improvise and sometimes you have

188
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:31,210
to do things that seem kind of abnormal

189
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:33,640
this is a picture of Rajat Suri he's the

190
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,530
founder of Elah cart yulik heart let's

191
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,599
restaurant customers order and pay

192
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,719
through a tablet he was a grad student

193
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,450
at MIT when he started the company and

194
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,640
he was so committed that he got a job as

195
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,940
a waiter to learn what restaurants were

196
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,190
like you see that air duct up there over

197
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,870
his head that looks like a halo this is

198
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,130
an exam

199
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,380
of a good founder here are the calls and

200
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,170
brothers who founded stripe Patrick

201
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,510
speaking right after me today actually

202
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,820
they do payment processing online when

203
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,010
these guys got started they were a pair

204
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,860
of young programmers they had no idea

205
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,890
how to make deals with banks and credit

206
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,960
card companies so I asked Patrick how

207
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,779
did you even convince these big

208
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,490
companies to work with you and one trick

209
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,470
he told me that worked was he started

210
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,630
with a phone call and then people would

211
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,120
pay attention to their arguments without

212
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,589
being distracted by their youth and by

213
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,029
the time they met in person and the

214
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,730
companies could tell how young they are

215
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:37,710
they were already impressed we funded

216
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,080
the lockitron guys back in the summer of

217
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,290
oh nine that's them actually at their YC

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,050
interview a year after YC they were

219
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,120
still figuring out their idea they lived

220
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,650
with the we pay guys and one day the we

221
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,750
pays were having a party for their

222
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,339
investors and by that point the

223
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,100
lockitron x' were working on a product

224
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,510
to lock your door with the iPhone they

225
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,370
were able to impress one of the

226
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,350
investors with their prototype and he

227
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,810
asked to have 40 installed at some

228
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,670
start-up offices he owned the founders

229
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,730
were totally psyched but the commercial

230
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,580
locks they needed to use cost 500 bucks

231
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,010
a pop they didn't have $20,000 to

232
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,470
fulfill that order so they went around

233
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,900
to local locksmiths and scrapyards

234
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,600
buying broken locks for 10 bucks apiece

235
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:25,110
they fixed them themselves and were able

236
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,180
to deliver on that order fast forward a

237
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,890
few years later and these guys were

238
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,080
ready to launch the newest version of

239
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,350
the lockitron and they decided to go on

240
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,950
Kickstarter and guess what a day after

241
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,690
lockitron submitted their campaign

242
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,990
Kickstarter changed their policy about

243
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,760
hardware companies and rejected them but

244
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,980
the lockitron guys decided to build

245
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,529
their own Kickstarter and they did it in

246
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,410
less than a week they wondered if anyone

247
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,300
would even come and not only did people

248
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,130
come but they've already sold close to

249
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,470
two million dollars worth of lockitron

250
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:02,610
x' that way so let me give you just one

251
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,750
last example

252
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,530
oops

253
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,300
ah there we go of improvising these are

254
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,340
the justin.tv founders when they first

255
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,370
got started and they were having a lot

256
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:17,970
of scaling issues and one weekend their

257
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:20,130
whole video system went down Kyle was in

258
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,390
charge of it but no one knew where Kyle

259
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:27,060
was and Kyle wasn't picking up his cell

260
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,460
phone this was live video so it was

261
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,500
pretty critical that this get fixed

262
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,170
immediately

263
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,180
so Michael Seibel called Kyle's friends

264
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,700
and found out that he was in late Lake

265
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,040
Tahoe and got the address so here's a

266
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,870
problem for you you know the address of

267
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,500
where someone is and he's not answering

268
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,540
his phone

269
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,840
how do you get a message to him

270
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,120
immediately Michael went onto Yelp and

271
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,180
looked for a pizza place near the house

272
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,340
and called them up and said I want to

273
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,740
have a pizza delivered but never mind

274
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,890
about the pizza just send the delivery

275
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,300
guy over and say these four words the

276
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,300
site is down

277
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,790
so the pizza place was like really

278
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,250
confused by this and they send the pizza

279
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,529
guy without a pizza kyle answers the

280
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,199
door the delivery guys like the site is

281
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:27,709
down Kyle's like oh no and he fixed the

282
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:32,930
site it was down for less than one hour

283
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:35,230
from start to finish all right so now

284
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,209
we're gonna move on to another monster

285
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,220
co-founder disputes I think people

286
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:42,290
underestimate how critical founder

287
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,839
relationships are to the success of a

288
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,949
startup

289
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,050
unfortunately I've seen more founder

290
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:51,350
breakups than I care to even count and

291
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,600
when it happens it can crush a startup

292
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,910
be very careful when you decide to start

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,769
a startup with someone do you know them

294
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,019
well have you worked with them or gone

295
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,519
to school with them don't just slap

296
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,740
yourself together with someone just

297
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,630
because they're available and seem good

298
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:11,360
enough you'll probably regret it and if

299
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,990
you start seeing red flags do something

300
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,420
about it

301
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,459
don't think it'll just go away it's a

302
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,069
red flag when you find yourself worrying

303
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,050
whether your co-founders trustworthy or

304
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:24,259
whether he or she works hard enough or

305
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,149
as competent when founders break up for

306
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:28,009
whatever reason it's a blow to the

307
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,319
startups productivity and morale if

308
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:32,600
there's three in one leaves it's not so

309
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:34,759
bad but if there's two and one leaves

310
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,589
it's hard because now you're a single

311
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:43,189
founder now we come to the investor

312
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:46,069
monster investors tend to have a herd

313
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:48,769
mentality they like you if other

314
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:51,110
investors like you so if no one likes

315
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,389
you until others do what happens when

316
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,149
you talk to the first ones no one likes

317
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:57,620
you it's like the catch-22 of not being

318
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,439
able to get a job because you don't have

319
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,569
enough experience you're except you're

320
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,730
really starting off in a hole and you

321
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:06,620
have to work your way out of it you have

322
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,899
to meet with lots of investors and hear

323
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,269
things like I'd be interested once you

324
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:14,420
get some more traction or who else is

325
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,459
investing if you work hard enough you

326
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,040
may be able to find a few people who are

327
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,480
excited enough about you and the idea to

328
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,760
fund you even though you don't have

329
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,980
other investors yet then when you have a

330
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,410
few investors you can start to make the

331
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,930
herd

332
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:32,339
tality work for you instead of against

333
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:35,069
you fundraising is hard and slow until

334
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,779
it's fast and easy but working to

335
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:41,300
convince those first few investors can

336
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,300
be really demoralizing it's a grind

337
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,220
investors also like to drag their feet

338
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,319
left to their own devices they'll just

339
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,399
keep delaying there's no downside for

340
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,740
them to delay

341
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,970
whereas delay will kill you because

342
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,579
while you're fundraising

343
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,990
your company will grind to a halt and by

344
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,699
the way there are some really good

345
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,800
investors who aren't like this I'm just

346
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,949
talking about the the median investor

347
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,439
but it blows my mind how many successful

348
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:10,050
startups had a hard time fundraising at

349
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:12,060
first if you remember one piece of

350
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,860
advice about investors it's that you've

351
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,399
got to create some type of competitive

352
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,439
situation I'll give you what is always

353
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,589
stuck in my mind is the most amazing

354
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:25,589
example of this one of the founders of

355
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:27,839
one of our more successful startups had

356
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:30,120
a long-standing relationship with a VC

357
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,689
so when the founder started the company

358
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,399
and did YC this VC kept in touch for the

359
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:37,290
three months not really doing anything

360
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,529
except kind of keeping a benevolent eye

361
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:44,189
on the founder the VC attended demo day

362
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,810
but didn't invest after a few months the

363
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:48,600
startup gets a term sheet from a

364
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,490
prestigious VC and for those of you in

365
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,880
the audience who don't know a term sheet

366
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,370
is an offer to invest in your company

367
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,579
when the vers VC heard about this he

368
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:02,759
shifted into panic mode he faxed the

369
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:06,750
founder a term sheet from his firm with

370
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,029
the valuation blank and just said fill

371
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,209
in whatever valuation you want and we're

372
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,209
in

373
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,740
and there are worse things investors can

374
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,860
do than just delay sometimes they say

375
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,900
yes and then change their mind it's not

376
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,970
a deal until the money is in the bank

377
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,460
and we've seen some founders learn that

378
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,290
the hard way I could tell you a lot of

379
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:34,580
horror stories to frighten you but just

380
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:36,920
remember that fundraising is a bitch why

381
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,200
see founders raise money under really

382
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:45,830
good circumstances and even for them

383
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:47,750
it's a bitch sorry to swear one of the

384
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,730
reasons fundraising can be so damaging

385
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,430
to your company is that it's a

386
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,010
distraction we warn everyone

387
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,300
early on it YC that there's you know you

388
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,430
need to be very careful about

389
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,190
distractions and no one's stupid enough

390
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,230
to play video games all day but the kind

391
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,600
of distractions founders fall for are

392
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,089
things that seem like a reasonable way

393
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,370
to spend their time we tell people that

394
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,230
during YC there's three things that they

395
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:15,230
should be focusing on writing code

396
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,449
talking to users and exercising and

397
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,900
maybe that's a little bit extreme but

398
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,459
the point is early on nothing else for

399
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,230
your startup matters you need to figure

400
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,730
out how to make something people want

401
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,980
and do it well

402
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,890
don't spend all your time networking

403
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:34,040
don't hire an army of interns just build

404
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:36,350
stuff and talk to users and by the way

405
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,360
fundraising is a distraction but it's a

406
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,960
necessary one so just try to spend as

407
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,580
little time on it as possible

408
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,040
one thing that isn't necessary and is a

409
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,070
bad distraction is talking to corporate

410
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,210
development people or Corp dev these are

411
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,130
people at big companies who buy startups

412
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,690
so you get a call from a Corp dev person

413
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,640
and they want to learn more about what

414
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,980
you're doing and explore possible ways

415
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,930
of working together the founder thinks

416
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,820
oh boy this important company wants to

417
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,580
work with me I should at least take the

418
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,620
meeting and I hate to sound harsh but

419
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,960
what these meetings are really for is a

420
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:17,840
way for them to see if they want to do

421
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,490
an HR acquisition and an HR acquisition

422
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,500
means they're essentially trying to hire

423
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,060
you and there's such a dangerous

424
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,590
distraction that I've given them their

425
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,370
own

426
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,440
monster there's nothing wrong with HR

427
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,990
acquisitions if that's what you want to

428
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,150
do but most founders don't start

429
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,400
startups just to get a job at a big

430
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,730
company for what essentially is a nice

431
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,159
hiring bonus talking to corporate have

432
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,400
people early on isn't just a waste of

433
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:48,370
time it's uniquely demoralizing and I

434
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,110
see the cycle happen over and over the

435
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,549
founders go to meet with the Corp dev

436
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,070
people and think the meeting was great

437
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:56,350
they're so friendly and enthusiastic and

438
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,299
the founders delude themselves into

439
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,340
thinking that their startup is going to

440
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,460
be the one that gets bought for ten

441
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,409
million dollars after only five months

442
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,240
they start to think okay yeah we'd kind

443
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:09,490
of like to get acquired and they start

444
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,399
to not work on their startup anymore and

445
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,559
they lose momentum then they get the

446
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:15,850
offer and it's essentially what they

447
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,220
would have gotten if they'd walked in

448
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,320
off the street and gotten a job but by

449
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,289
then they've gotten so accustomed to the

450
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,419
idea of selling that they take it so

451
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:31,450
going down the Corp dev road seriously

452
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:34,299
can deflate your ambitions okay now we

453
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,100
come to the fiercest monster of all the

454
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:39,580
difficulty of making something people

455
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,740
want it's so hard that most startups

456
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,270
aren't able to do it you're trying to

457
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,179
figure out something that's never been

458
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,549
done before not making something people

459
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,279
want is the biggest cause of failure we

460
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:53,710
see early on with the second biggest

461
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,630
being founder disputes in order to make

462
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,570
something people want being brilliant

463
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,700
and determined is not enough you have to

464
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,580
be able to talk to your users and adjust

465
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,929
your idea accordingly and ordinarily you

466
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,789
have to change your idea quite a lot

467
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,100
even if you start out with a reasonably

468
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,980
good one

469
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,510
remember this website air

470
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,880
bed-and-breakfast was a rather narrower

471
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,380
idea when they first launched they

472
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,140
started out as a site that let people

473
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,230
rent out air beds to travelers for

474
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,690
conferences then they changed to renting

475
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,270
out air beds then they change to renting

476
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,610
out a room or a couch but the hosts had

477
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,799
to be there to make breakfast then they

478
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,659
finally realized that there was all this

479
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,580
pent-up demand to rent out entire places

480
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:40,590
this evolution shows that you may begin

481
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,929
with kind of a general vision of what

482
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,789
your startup is doing but you often have

483
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,940
to try several different approaches to

484
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:50,190
get it right and sometimes you have to

485
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,619
totally change your idea order ahead

486
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,190
which lets you order takeout on your

487
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:58,080
cellphone was the founders sixth idea we

488
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,669
funded them for the first thing I think

489
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,679
they presented on demo day with the

490
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:06,840
third and it wasn't until order ahead

491
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,009
that they hit on their big idea even if

492
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,889
you don't need to change the overall

493
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,349
idea much you still tend to have to do

494
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:16,529
lots of refinement and one of the best

495
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:19,049
examples of this is Dropbox here's a

496
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:22,649
photo of drew Houston during YC in the

497
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:23,580
summer of a 7 he and Arash were working

498
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:26,309
on something that was obviously

499
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,169
necessary but the reason it was hard to

500
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:29,970
predict early on whether they'd succeed

501
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:33,179
is that there were lots of people doing

502
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,759
this the way to win in this world was to

503
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,239
execute well and it didn't happen

504
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,159
overnight

505
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:40,349
they had to get a thousand and one

506
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,509
details right there were a lot of

507
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:48,529
unglamorous schleps between that

508
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:51,509
photograph and this one looks good

509
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:53,580
between starting the company and being

510
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:57,029
on the cover of Forbes you're gonna have

511
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,769
some dramatic ups and downs in a startup

512
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:01,190
you don't have the damping that you'd

513
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:03,269
have as part of a larger organization

514
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,269
circumstances just kind of fling you

515
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:08,369
about the process is often described as

516
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,970
a roller coaster because you're up one

517
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:13,379
minute and down the next lots of

518
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,019
rollercoaster stories that I know

519
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:18,629
involve fundraising and one of the most

520
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:22,379
extreme ones happened to some people we

521
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:24,330
funded in their previous startup it was

522
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:26,549
based in Houston and they got a term

523
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,349
sheet from a top-tier VC in Silicon

524
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,720
Valley and one of the conditions was

525
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:31,229
that they base their company in the

526
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,570
valley

527
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:39,359
so they said fine they sold their houses

528
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:41,279
they they moved their families into

529
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,369
corporate housing in Houston until they

530
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,470
found places in the valley the documents

531
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:48,890
were already signed and the money was

532
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,440
scheduled to be wired on Friday and

533
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:54,830
we're gonna start working on Monday out

534
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,900
of the VCS office so Friday comes around

535
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,260
and for some reason the money was not

536
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,120
wired so they call the VC to ask if they

537
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,970
should still come out and the VC is like

538
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,770
absolutely so they get into their

539
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,470
minivan and they drive from Houston to

540
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,810
Silicon Valley and they stop in Vegas to

541
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:16,310
celebrate this is the up part of the

542
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,690
rollercoaster so on Monday they set up

543
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,700
all their stuff in the conference room

544
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,550
of the VC fund all six of their team

545
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,640
there and by that Wednesday the money

546
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,860
was still not wired so they had a bored

547
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,070
weaning plan for that day and they

548
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,860
decide to invite the VC and in this

549
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,660
meeting the CEO talked about how sign up

550
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,490
numbers had gone down temporarily

551
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,040
because they had changed the way they

552
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,620
measured them I think you know how this

553
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:45,010
story is gonna turn out the VC had

554
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,130
actually gotten buyer's remorse and he

555
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:50,480
used this as an excuse to break the deal

556
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,120
remember they had signed all the

557
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,830
documents sold their homes moved to

558
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,690
Silicon Valley and we're just waiting to

559
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,440
get the seven million dollars wired to

560
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,390
them and instead the VC bails he kicks

561
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,340
them out of their conference room the

562
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,500
founders had to call their wives back in

563
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,540
Houston and go back with their tails

564
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,200
between their legs and they had delay

565
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,090
everyone off can you imagine just a few

566
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,470
days before they were celebrating in

567
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,400
Vegas and now they have nothing

568
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,230
incidentally to get to a story this

569
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,270
extreme we had to use an example of a

570
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,060
startup we didn't find fun cuz I don't

571
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,820
think a VC would probably do this to a

572
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,020
startup we funded now let me just tell

573
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,660
you about the other half of the

574
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,810
rollercoaster we funded the codecademy

575
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,790
team in the summer of 2011 their

576
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,020
original idea didn't work and they kept

577
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,180
exploring new ones

578
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,590
it wasn't until late July that they

579
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,080
started working on their idea for

580
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,570
teaching people to code online they

581
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,660
launched just three days before demo day

582
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,880
and in those three days they got over

583
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,530
200,000 users I mean they only launched

584
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
so they could get up on demo day and say

585
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,690
that they were a launch company that

586
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,400
Zach Sims they're presenting on demo day

587
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,200
they never expected that in just three

588
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,720
days

589
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,390
they could go from a start up with a nun

590
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,770
launched idea and get up on stage and

591
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,660
announce they had two hundred thousand

592
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,260
users which is just about the most

593
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:17,020
exciting thing you can say to investors

594
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,990
the theme here is how extreme things can

595
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,600
be just remember that no extreme ever

596
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:24,790
lasts don't let yourself get immobilized

597
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,890
by sadness when things go wrong just

598
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:29,620
keep putting one foot in front of the

599
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,210
other and no will get better but don't

600
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,790
get complacent when things are going

601
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:37,180
well in reality things are never as bad

602
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:38,710
or as good as they seem and by the way

603
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,720
what makes this roller coaster even

604
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,000
worse is that while you're on it there's

605
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,850
this huge audience watching everything

606
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,100
you do you'll have trolls and reporters

607
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,980
say outrageous things about you online

608
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:55,330
so be ready for that and have a thick

609
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,670
skin so everyone knows that startups are

610
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,310
hard yet when we watch people do them

611
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,170
they're always surprised the reason

612
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,360
they're surprised is that they don't

613
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,970
realize how bad these specific problems

614
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,490
can be I've seen some very smart and

615
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,400
talented people get so demoralized that

616
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,470
they just gave up startups are not for

617
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
the faint of heart and I realize that

618
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,120
this is not new news but I wanted you to

619
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,640
at least understand how they're hard

620
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,150
early on so that when you run into these

621
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,390
specific monsters you'll know what to do

622
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,390
thank you
