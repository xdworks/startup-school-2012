**Jessica Livingston at Startup School 2012-KQJ6zsNCA-4.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Hi everyone.

So believe this year I can\'t believe we have this team of people in the back helping.

There\'s real chairs.

Look how many seats there are.

 \[00:00:12\] This is so exciting.

I\'m Jessica Livingston.

I\'m one of the founders of Y Combinator and it\'s been more than seven years since we started ricey.

And in that time we\'ve funded 467 startups so I\'ve seen a lot of pattern.

I was a little nervous back there so thanks.

There\'s a talk I always want to give at the beginning of each batch warning everyone about stuff that I know is probably going to happen to them.

I finally wrote down my thoughts and I\'m going to share it with you today.

So we all know that lots of smart and talented people start startups on the left side.

There you see huge numbers of startups getting started.

And yet if you look at the other side a few years later there\'s actually only a handful of startups that are big successes.

What\'s happening in the middle there that\'s causing such failure.

It\'s like there\'s a tunnel full of monsters that kill them along the way.

And I just want to thank Mineau monsters for providing me these fabulous cartoon monsters.

So I\'m gonna tell you about these monsters today so you can know how to avoid them in general.

Your best weapon against these monsters is determination and even though we usually use one word for it determination is really two separate things.

It\'s resilience and drive resilience keeps you from being pushed backwards and drive makes you go forwards.

One reason you need resilience in a startup is that you\'re going to get rejected a lot.

Even the most famous startups had a surprising amount of rejection early on.

Everyone you encounter will have doubts about what you are doing whether it\'s investors potential employees reporters your family and friends.

What you don\'t realize until you start a startup is how much external validation you\'ve gotten for the conservative choices you\'ve made in the past.

You go to college and everyone says great you graduate and get a job at Google and everyone says Great.

Well what do you think happens when you quit your job to start a company to rent out air beds.

This is air Beinn BS Web site.

When they first launched in 2007.

I mean look up there were they explain what they do it says to designers create a new way to connect the idea say conference I\'ve never even heard of that conference.

And over on the left it says Lyster air bed.

 \[00:02:57\] Beds.

I mean it\'s unbelievable.

 \[00:02:59\] This is not the sort of thing that you get a lot of external validation for.

Almost everyone is more impressed when you get a job at Google than if you make a Web site for people to rent out air beds for conferences.

And yet this is one of the most successful startups.

So even if you\'re Airbnb Inbee you\'re gonna start out looking like an ugly duckling to most people.

Here are the Airbnb Inbee founders when they did Y C back in early 2009.

And at this point they\'d already endured tons of rejection.

You should check out Brian\'s talk from the 2010 Startup School it\'s a very inspirational story but by the time they came to us they had maxed out their credit cards.

They were eating leftover Captain McCain\'s cereal.

They were at the end of their rope and everyone thought their idea was crazy.

And I actually didn\'t.

But they knew they were on to something.

And during Lycee they made some key changes to their site.

They talk to users.

They set their goals and they measured everything and the graph started to go up.

Remember the new ideas usually seem crazy at first but if you have a good idea and you execute well everyone will see it eventually.

We funded Eric Makowski about two years ago when he was working on impulse the predecessor to the Pebble Watch.

Eric was a single founder and these watches there have something in common.

That terrifies investors.

Their hardware.

Poor Eric had a really hard time getting funding no one wanted to fund the hardware company.

He met with more than like 30 investors who all said things like I love the idea but I can\'t fund a hardware company.

Some claim they just didn\'t fund hardware companies as a rule.

Others said that there are too many capital expenses upfront.

They all said no when he showed them the concept but he\'d been building the pebble based on all this user feedback from impulse and he felt strongly that people wanted this product.

So I remember he talked to Paul and they agreed he should just give up investors and put it on Kickstarter.

His original goal was to raise a hundred thousand dollars to make a thousand watches and instead of a hundred thousand dollars pebble raised ten point two million dollars in 30 days the largest amount of money ever on Kickstarter.

Even a Y Combinator got rejected when we first started.

This here is our first batch.

Sitting at dinner in Cambridge Massachusetts back in 0 5.

Now there are lots of organizations doing what we do.

But trust me when we first started people thought we were crazy or just stupid.

Even our own lawyers tried to talk us out of it.

But eight teams of founders took a chance on Y Combinator and moved to Cambridge and got their twelve thousand dollars per team.

And I think they tell you they had a really great experience.

We too knew we were onto something interesting.

So we focused on making something that a few people loved and we just expanded slowly from there.

But it was a slow process when we came out to Silicon Valley in the winter of 06.

We hardly knew anyone so we decided we\'d focus on meeting new investors to convince them to come to demo day.

 \[00:06:35\] I got an introduction to theNo.1 angel investor in the valley Ron Conaway and let me show you how he tried different brushes off so we get the introduction.

And Ron says is this in Boston.

I stick to local and I said no we\'re in Mountain View and we\'d love to have you come to demo day and he said.

So is this a chance to invest in your incubator.

And I replied No we\'re not asking you to invest in us.

We\'re asking you to invest in individual startups and he said.

Off to circle back to you.

I\'m jammed up.

We\'ve got the jammed up right now from Long car waves so embarrassing.

Oh my gosh.

But it all worked out in the end.

Here\'s Ron.

 \[00:07:23\] A year later speaking to the winter 07 batch of founders he did wind up coming into demo day and he was impressed with what he saw.

Remember if you execute well eventually you\'ll win people over.

And by the way I should also point out that there\'s David Wu Sanco who\'s speaking later today and there\'s Harge to Garh.

Is now partner NYC.

It was their batch.

Remember there were two components to determination resilience and drive.

We\'ve talked about why you need resilience because everyone will be down on you but you need drive to overcome the sheer variety of problems they\'ll face in a startup.

Some of them are painfully specific like a lawsuit or a deal blowing up and some are demoralizing only vague like no one\'s visiting your site and you can\'t figure out why there\'s no playbook you can consult when these problems come up.

You have to improvise and sometimes you have to do things that seem kind of abnormal.

This is a picture of a job.

Sorry.

He\'s the founder of Ã¦lla cart you Lockheart lets restaurant customers order and pay through a tablet.

He was a grad student atM.I.T.

when he started the company and he was so committed that he got a job as a waiter to learn what restaurants were like.

You see that air duct up there over his head that looks like a halo.

This is an example of a good founder.

Here are the Carlson brothers who founded stripe.

Patrick speaking right after me today actually they do payment processing online.

When these guys got started they were a pair of young programmers then no idea how to make deals with banks and credit card companies.

So I asked Patrick how did you even convince these big companies to work with you.

And one Trickey told me that worked was he started with a phone call and then people would pay attention to their arguments without being distracted by their youth.

And by the time they met in person and the companies could tell how young they are they were already impressed.

We funded the Lockard Tron guys back in the summer of 0 9.

That\'s them actually at their Y see interview a year afterwards.

They were still figuring out their idea.

They lived with the we pay guys and one day The Weepies were having a party for their investors.

And by that point the lock at trons were working on a product to lock your door with the iPhone.

They were able to impress one of the investors with their prototype and he asked to have 40 installed at some startup offices he owned.

The founders were totally psyched.

But the commercial locks they needed to use cost five hundred bucks a pop.

They didn\'t have twenty thousand dollars to fulfill that order.

So they went around to local locksmiths and scrapyards buying broken locks for ten bucks apiece.

They fixed them themselves and were able to deliver on that order.

Fast forward a few years later and these guys were ready to launch the newest version of the lock Tron and they decided to go on Kickstarter and guess what.

A day after lock Itron submit did their campaign.

Kickstarter changed their policy about hardware companies and rejected them.

But the lock Itron guys decided to build their own Kickstarter and they did it in less than a week.

They wondered if anyone would even come.

And not only did people come but they\'ve already sold close to 2 million dollars worth of Lockard trons that way.

So let me give you just one last example.

Whoops.

There we go.

Improvising.

These are the justin tv founders when they first got started and they were having a lot of scaling issues and one weekend their whole video system went down.

 \[00:11:17\] Kyle was in charge of it but no one knew where Kyle was and Kyle wasn\'t picking up his cell phone.

 \[00:11:25\] This was like a video so it was pretty critical that this get fixed immediately.

So Michael seeable called Kyle\'s friends and found out that he was in Lake Lake Tahoe and got the address.

So here\'s a problem for you.

You know the address of where someone is and he\'s not answering his phone.

How do you get a message to him immediately.

 \[00:11:47\] Michael went on to yelp and looked for a pizza place near the house and called them up and said I want to have a pizza delivered but never mind about the pizza.

Just send the delivery guy over and say these four words.

The site is down.

So the pizza place was like really confused by this and they send the pizza guy without a pizza.

Kyle answers the door to the delivery guys like the site is down.

Kyle\'s like.

Oh no.

And he fixed the site.

It was down for less than one hour from start to finish.

 \[00:12:32\] All right.

So now we\'re going to move on to another monster co-founder disputes.

I think people underestimate how critical founder relationships are to the success of a startup.

Unfortunately I\'ve seen more founder breakups than I care to even count.

And when it happens it can crush a startup.

Be very careful when you decide to start a startup with someone.

Do you know them well.

Have you worked with them or gone to school with them.

Don\'t just slap yourself together with someone just because they\'re available and seem good enough.

You\'ll probably regret it.

And if you start seeing red flags do something about it don\'t think it\'ll just go away.

It\'s a red flag when you find yourself worrying whether your co-founder is trustworthy or whether he or she works hard enough or is competent when founders break up for whatever reason.

It\'s a blow to the startups productivity and morale.

If there\'s three and one leaves it\'s not so bad.

But if there\'s two and one leaves it\'s hard because now you\'re a single founder.

Now we come to the investor monster.

Investors tend to have a herd mentality.

They like you.

If other investors like you.

So if no one likes you until others do.

What happens when you talk to the first ones.

No one likes you.

It\'s like the catch 22 of not being able to get a job because you don\'t have enough experience.

You\'re except you\'re really starting off in a hole and you have to work your way out of it.

You have to meet with lots of investors and hear things like I\'d be interested once you get some more traction or who else is investing.

If you work hard enough you may be able to find a few people who are excited enough about you and the idea to fund you even though you don\'t have other investors yet.

Then when you have a few investors you can start to make that herd mentality work for you instead of against you.

Fundraising is hard and slow until it\'s fast and easy.

But working to convince those first few investors can be really demoralizing.

It\'s a grind.

Investors also like to drag their feet left to their own devices.

They\'ll just keep delaying there\'s no downside for them to delay whereas delay will kill you because while you\'re fundraising your company will grind to a halt.

And by the way there are some really good investors who aren\'t like this.

I\'m just talking about the median investor but it blows my mind how many successful startups had a hard time fundraising at first.

If you remember one piece of advice about investors it\'s that you\'ve got to create some type of competitive situation.

I\'ll give you what is always stuck in my mind as the most amazing example of this.

One of the founders of one of our more successful startups.

Had a longstanding relationship with aV.C.

So when the founder started the company and did we see this Fisi kept in touch for three months not really doing anything except kind of keeping a benevolent eye on the founder.

The Veazey attended Demo Day but didn\'t invest.

After a few months the startup gets a term sheet from a procedure Veazey.

And for those of you in the audience who don\'t know a term sheet is an offer to invest in your company.

When the first Veazey heard about this he shifted into panic mode.

He faxed the founder a term sheet from his firm with the valuation blank and just said in whatever valuation you want and Worryin.

And there are worse things investors can do than just delay.

Sometimes they say yes and then change their mind.

It\'s not a deal until the money is in the bank.

And we\'ve seen some founders learn that the hard way.

I could tell you a lot of horror stories to frighten you.

But just remember that fundraisings a bitch.

 \[00:16:34\] Why see founders raise money under really good circumstances.

And even for them it\'s a bitch.

 \[00:16:42\] Sardis where one of the reasons fundraising can be so damaging to your company is that it\'s a distraction.

We warn everyone early on and why see that there\'s no need to be very careful about distractions and no one is stupid enough to play video games all day but the kind of distractions founders fall for are things that seem like a reasonable way to spend their time.

We tell people that during Y C there\'s three things that they should be focusing on.

Writing code talking to users and exercising and maybe that\'s a little bit extreme but the point is early on.

Nothing else for your startup matters.

You need to figure out how to make something people want and do it well.

Don\'t spend all your time networking don\'t hire an army of interns just build stuff and talk to users.

And by the way fundraising is a distraction but it\'s a necessary ones.

Just try to spend as little time on it as possible.

One thing that isn\'t necessary and is a bad distraction is talking to corporate development people or corp dev.

These are people at big companies who buy startups so you get a call from a corp dev person and they want to learn more about what you\'re doing and explore possible ways of working together.

The founders thanks.

Oh boy.

This important company wants to work with me.

I should at least take the meeting and I hate to sound harsh but what these meetings are really for is a way for them to see if they want to do anH.R.

acquisition.

And anH.R.

acquisition means they\'re essentially trying to hire you.

And there\'s such a dangerous distraction that I\'ve given them their own little monster.

There\'s nothing wrong withH.R.

acquisitions if that\'s what you want to do.

But most founders don\'t start startups just to get a job at a big company for what essentially is a nice hiring bonus.

Talking to corp people early on isn\'t just a waste of time.

It\'s uniquely demoralizing.

And I see the cycle happen over and over.

The founders go to meet with the corp dev people and think the meeting was great.

They\'re so friendly and enthusiastic and the founders delude themselves into thinking that their startup is going to be the one that gets bought for ten million dollars after only five months they start to think OK yeah we\'d kind of like to get acquired and they start to not work on their startup anymore and they lose momentum then they get the offer and it\'s essentially what they would have gotten if they\'d walked in off the street and gotten a job.

But by then they\'ve gotten so accustomed to the idea of selling that they take it.

So going down the corpse Evros seriously can deflate your ambitions.

OK now we come to the fiercest monster of all the difficulty of making something people want.

It\'s so hard that most startups aren\'t able to do it.

You\'re trying to figure out something that\'s never been done before.

Not making something people want is the biggest cause of failure we see early on with the second biggest being found or disputes in order to make something people want.

Being brilliant and determined is not enough.

You have to be able to talk to our users and adjust your idea accordingly.

Ordinarily you have to change your idea quite a lot even if you start out with a reasonably good one.

Remember this Web site Air Bed and Breakfast was a rather narrower idea when they first launched.

They started out as a site that let people rent out air beds to travellers for conferences.

Then they changed to renting out air beds.

Then they changed to renting out a room or a couch.

But the host had to be there to make breakfast.

Then they finally realized that there was all this pent up demand to rent out entire places.

This evolution shows that you may begin with kind of a general vision of what your startup is doing but you often have to try several different approaches to get it right.

And sometimes you have to totally change your idea or order head which lets you order takeout on your cell phone was the founders 6th idea.

We funded them for the first thing I think they presented on demo day with the third and it wasn\'t until order ahead that they hit on their big idea.

Even if you don\'t need to change the overall idea much you still tend to have to do lots of refinement and one of the best examples of this is Dropbox.

Here\'s a photo of Drew Housden during Lycee in the summer of 0 7.

He had a rash were working on something that was obviously necessary but the reason it was hard to predict early on whether they\'d succeed is that there were lots of people doing this.

The way to win in this world was to execute well and it didn\'t happen overnight.

They had to get 1001 details right.

There were a lot of unglamorous schleps between that photograph and this one.

Looks good between starting the company and being on the cover of Forbes.

You\'re going to have some dramatic ups and downs in a startup.

You don\'t have the damping that you\'d have as part of a larger organization circumstances just kind of fooling you about the process is often described as a rollercoaster because your up one minute and down the next.

Lots of rollercoaster stories that I know involve fundraising.

And one of the most extreme ones happened to some people we funded in their previous startup.

It was based in Houston and they got a term sheet from a top tier Risi in Silicon Valley and one of the conditions was that they base their company in the valley.

So they said fine.

They sold their houses.

They they moved their families into corporate housing in Houston until they found places in the valley.

The documents were already signed and the money was scheduled to be wired on Friday and they were going to start working on Monday.

Out of the VCR is office.

So Friday comes around and for some reason the money was not wired.

So they call the you to ask if they should still come out and the like.

Absolutely.

So they get into their minivan and they drive from Houston to Silicon Valley and they stop in Vegas to celebrate.

This is the part of the rollercoaster.

So on my.

They set up all their stuff in the conference room with a refund all six of their team there and by that Wednesday the money was still not wired so they had a board meeting planned for that day and they decide to invite theV.C.

And in this meeting the CEO talked about how sign up numbers had gone down temporarily because they had changed the way they measured them.

I think you know how this story story\'s going to turn out theV.C.

had actually gotten buyer\'s remorse and he used this as an excuse to break the deal.

Remember they had signed all the documents sold their homes moved to Silicon Valley and were just waiting to get the 7 million dollars wired to them.

And instead theV.C.

bales he kicks them out of their conference room.

The founders had to call their wives back in Houston and go back with their tails between their legs and they had to lay everyone off.

Can you imagine just a few days before they were celebrating in Vegas and now they have nothing incidentally to get to a story this extreme we had.

Here\'s an example of a startup we didn\'t fund because I don\'t think a would probably do this to a startup.

We funded.

Now let me just tell you about the other half of the rollercoaster.

We funded the code Kaddoumi team in the summer of 2011.

Their original idea didn\'t work and they kept exploring new ones.

It wasn\'t until late July that they started working on their idea for teaching people to code online.

They launched just three days before Demo Day and in those three days they got over 200000 users.

I mean they only launched so they could get up on demo day and say that they were a launch company that Zach Sims they\'re presenting on demo day.

They never expected that in just three days they could go from a startup with a non launched idea and get up on stage and announce they had 200000 users which is just about the most exciting thing you can say to investors.

The theme here is how extreme things can be.

Just remember that no extreme ever lasts.

Don\'t let yourself get immobilized by sadness when things go wrong.

Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and know it will get better but don\'t get complacent when things are going well.

In reality things are never as bad or as good as they seem.

And by the way what makes this rollercoaster even worse is that while you\'re on it there\'s this huge audience watching everything you do.

You\'ll have trolls and reporters say outrageous things about you online so be ready for that and have a thick skin so everyone knows it.

Startups are hard.

Yet when we watch people do them they\'re always surprised.

The reason they\'re surprised is that they don\'t realize how bad these specific problems can be.

I\'ve seen some very smart and talented people get so demoralized that they just gave up.

Startups are not for the faint of heart.

And I realize that this is not new news but I wanted you to at least understand how their hard early on so that when you run into these specific monsters you\'ll know what to do.

Thank you.
