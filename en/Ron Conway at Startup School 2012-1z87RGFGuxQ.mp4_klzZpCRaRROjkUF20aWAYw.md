**Ron Conway at Startup School 2012-1z87RGFGuxQ.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] The funny thing is we\'re we\'re sitting in the back seeing which switch stories can we tell in which ones are too secret because for every wrong who is like an iceberg for every story.

Where were you where you hear how he saved the day.

There\'s a bunch where you can never tell how he saved the day he was ever seen Pulp Fiction sort of like the Wolf.

He\'s clean cleaned a lot of brains off the back wins windows and cars.

 \[00:00:27\] He laughs nervously but does not contradict me.

So Ron and Ron like officially Ron is ASV angel right.

 \[00:00:38\] You are the limited partners.

Something like that of SB angel.

 \[00:00:41\] I\'m not a managing partner.

David Leighs the managing partner because I don\'t like being a fiduciary.

I am just the largest investor.

 \[00:00:50\] But officially Ron Conway doesn\'t invest in your company worthS.V.

angel investor right.

So if you ever see that in a cap table that\'s that\'s Ranko.

 \[00:00:59\] So how many startups have you funded now since 1994.

About six hundred and fifty 1994.

 \[00:01:08\] How many and we\'re not born yet in 1994.

It\'s not that many 650 including Can you name some of the more successful ones.

 \[00:01:21\] Ask Jeeves was the first.

A good quality event that we had Google Facebook Twitter page how Pinterest.

 \[00:01:30\] OK.

You\'re doing pretty well.

 \[00:01:33\] And then and then the see companies air BMV and Dropbox.

The way I see companies that are already getting very big scale.

 \[00:01:43\] How did you how did you get into this.

You started out as a founder yourself right back when startups made computers.

Right.

 \[00:01:52\] Even though I don\'t invest in hardware today the company that I cofounded was Alto\'s computer back in the late 70s and we ended up taking their company public in 1982 and and my experience at Alto\'s plus two other startups that I cofounded is what gives me such respect for what entrepreneurs go through.

The theme all day is that hey it\'s not easy it\'s it\'s actually hard.

I know that because I did it it was even harder then in a lot of ways.

You\'re raising money stories.

Yes.

Back in 0 back in the late 70s in order to get venture capital you had to have high growth and be profitable if you weren\'t you didn\'t even qualify.

 \[00:02:48\] So why did people take venture capital profitable and growing fast.

Well in the case of Alto it was a hardware company.

 \[00:02:56\] So we had a lot of cost of goods and marketing.

And so we wanted to build a war chest to keep building the business.

 \[00:03:06\] Okay.

 \[00:03:07\] So that in fact Da Vinci was Don Valentine from Sequoia who you know is really I think the patron saint of venture capital patron.

 \[00:03:18\] He\'s retired now.

What was.

What\'s changed about startups since then.

 \[00:03:27\] Well I I think it\'s I\'d rather talk about what\'s not changed.

 \[00:03:33\] OK sure.

That was going to be my next question.

Oh yes.

 \[00:03:37\] Because what\'s not changed is what Jessica talked about which is you have to have determination and conviction.

You have to be a leader.

You know what has changed is in the workplace people drink less at Alto\'s.

 \[00:04:01\] That\'s not what I thought you were going to buy in the back of my mind.

 \[00:04:03\] I\'ve been saying hey wait a minute I want to answer the question about what has changed at Alto\'s.

We had a CFO who is in her 60s and at five o\'clock everyday she would wheel around the booze cart everyone would have a drink chit chat for a little bit.

It wasn\'t even a happy hour.

It was a happy 10 minutes.

But then it motivated everyone to stay till 9 or 10 o\'clock at night.

Now our Modou are kind of a model was work hard and play hard.

 \[00:04:38\] And at the same time Yeah we actually we did it via multitasking I think the startup\'s today know how to segment a little better and they have happy hour at the on a Friday instead of everyday instead of everyday.

So what else is changing besides breaking.

 \[00:05:00\] Well I think what has not changed is is the fact that once you you have to focus on growth.

Back in the hardware days you didn\'t have to focus.

In my opinion on product or consumer satisfaction is much interesting.

Yeah it was more like you know Ship Ship Ship and get it out and if it doesn\'t work take it back and fix it because hardware was so hard to ship that if you could ship at all.

 \[00:05:31\] That was consumer satisfaction.

Exactly.

Customers were happy just to get it back at the end of it if it didn\'t work.

 \[00:05:38\] We had this big RMV department return material authorizations.

But today what\'s changed.

And now whileS.V.

Ã¡ngela the best decision I ever made in 1994 was only to invest in Internet software in 1994 in 1994 so I think hardware scarred me.

But but that was the best decision I ever made is that in 94 thinking this thing called the Internet is going to be really disruptive.

 \[00:06:12\] Back then like 1984.

It probably meant the Internet not the web like the web sort of existed.

 \[00:06:17\] Had you heard of it when you decided to go into Internet investing back in 1990 were you thinking like FPP in e-mail.

Well it would be it would be more like people would say TCAP IP.

 \[00:06:30\] Yeah as often as they would say the Internet.

And I remember it as TCAP IP at the time but in the end people would talk about email but know they\'d have to explain what e-mail was.

 \[00:06:44\] It was this protocol on TCAP IP.

 \[00:06:49\] So you sort of didn\'t get in at the ground floor of an idiot investor and you got it in a basement or in the basement go up say yes to the lowly went up the stairs to the to the first floor.

How did you like that was a really good decision.

It turns out to get into Internet investing in 1994.

But like why did how did you do that.

 \[00:07:08\] Well I was in CO investing with Ben Rosen at the time after founding a couple of companies I discovered because I started dabbling in angel investing that I really enjoyed mentoring entrepreneurs more than being the entrepreneur or myself.

So in 94 is when I sold my second company and went home and told my wife hey you know I found a new job and she said I didn\'t know you were looking.

And I said Yeah I\'m going to do this angel investing for the rest of my life.

 \[00:07:44\] What did she think of that.

Did she know what she was getting into.

 \[00:07:47\] She\'s always thought it was crazy so she thinks I\'m crazy today.

But but.

 \[00:07:56\] I sat with Ben Rosen who is then the chairman of Compaq.

Ben lives in New York and we said.

Innovation is all about growth.

So we said let\'s just find a sector that\'s growing like crazy or is going to grow like crazy and be disruptive because innovation is disruptive.

And we said hey let\'s let\'s just throw all in on the internet so our only rural is Internet software and off we went in sitting here today still only Internet software.

Now the market\'s gotten huge.

I still think we\'re in the infancy on the internet though I\'ve been saying this since 1994 I believe it more than ever.

Just add a little touch of e-commerce on top of the Internet and you\'re talking about you know an opportunity that\'s as big as all the Internet today especially with with Facebook an open graph helping companies go find their customers and Pinterest will probably be an effect fact I\'ll quote the monetization guy on twitter.

I won\'t even take the risk of misquoting but the monetization guy at Twitter told me a couple of weeks ago he goes a Twitter is on a tear.

Now you know like Google and Facebook once they get to stride you know Twitter\'s got a really nice growth rate now took awhile more than normal revenue growth revenue growth.

Okay this is about revenue growth and this guy said to me it will never grow like Pinterest was once they decide to monetize because they will be an e-commerce engine like never before and they\'ll there\'ll be many other companies like that that take advantage of e-commerce.

So it\'s it\'s early days.

 \[00:09:53\] That\'s encouraging.

Yeah I couldn\'t be more and you agree with you agree with Ben Horowitz there\'s still stuff left here and lots of lots.

So what are the biggest.

What are the biggest misses you\'ve had.

You remember some big ones you missed.

 \[00:10:08\] Well yes.

This is in 1998 99 when the bubble was starting to take effect and I thought 30 million dollar valuation forSalesforce.com was a little too high.

It\'s 21 billion today.

Pandora Pandora.

I had just gotten out of Napster Napster fire and finally had to declare bankruptcy because of all the egos in the world and in the music world.

I don\'t think it\'s just egos in them.

I wish.

And so I was I was hedging on the music space so for that reason I didn\'t invest in Pandora Palin Teer could have injured invested there didn\'t understand the size of the market even though we invest in the entrepreneur first.

In the case of Pandora you know I made a dumb move and said hey I\'m not sure I get how big that market is.

Kickstarter we could have invested in it in early as well didn\'t really get what.

What crowdsourcing was.

And look at that space today.

It\'s it\'s the lifeblood for a lot of startups and we have the.

The jobs act that takes the legal confusion out of crowdsourcing.

 \[00:11:43\] Do you think.

Do you think there\'s a pattern to what investors miss.

In general not just you but investors in general.

If there\'s a founders are working on something that\'s good but investors are not going to get like what kind of things do investors not get.

 \[00:11:59\] Well I think investors don\'t get probably the stuff that is you know is the first one.

Pinterest would be an example.

Ben talked about how hard it was to raise money.

And if you look at a virtual Pinboard you know that\'s a brand new idea.

So I think investors even though they like to say I\'m in venture capital I take risk.

They look for pattern recognition which in this business is probably a mistake.

Look at Twitter in the early days you know that was that was a brand that was a brand new idea and lots of Easy\'s turned down Twitter.

 \[00:12:46\] So with SFE you\'ll tell the story of how you ended up investing in Twitter.

Sure that\'s a funny story with a way it is with V Angel though we invest in in the entrepreneur first.

 \[00:13:00\] We invest in the human being and all of our biggest successes is when we said hey wow that\'s a really forward thinking idea but let\'s go run with it.

I love that entrepreneur.

I want to invest in every one of their companies.

So so when I invest in an entrepreneur I\'m investing for life unless they do something wrong.

I want to invest for example in Shawn Fanning\'s sixth startup airtime.

So for me it\'s it\'s a lifelong commitment.

It makes it more interesting when you have this awesome relationship with a founder where they know me like a book and I know them like a book so we can move fast and give each other advice.

So you invested in Odeo right.

Yeah.

So back to Twitter.

Back to Twitter I invested in Odeo with Evan Williams and his team Jack Dorsey was part of that team.

So is Biz Stone and ODEIO didn\'t work out and Odeo was in an incubator called ObviousCorp.

So it is a classical innovator incubator who had like four or five projects going on Twitter was one of those other projects.

Jack was the father of the Twitter project and Odeo ended up shutting down.

 \[00:14:21\] Evan Williams was magnanimous to the investors and gave the investors their money back.

Here\'s an entrepreneur.

Felt so bad and he had made a little bit of money not a ton of money certainly not enough to give your money back.

He made a little bit of money selling Blogger to Google but he he felt an obligation to pay the investors back and I said this is going to sit in the bank until your next one and the next one was Twitter.

So I invested 75 K in Twitter site on scene zero due diligence because I believed in that entrepreneur and then I got to know Jack and and look at Twitter today.

 \[00:15:01\] So you just you were already signed up for Twitter.

I was free where it was three three boarded on that airplane.

That\'s what I called betting on foul with no with no questions asked.

What did you think of Twitter as an idea.

Guess what.

Never.

 \[00:15:20\] Never argue with the metrics.

So Twitter.

It wasn\'t long before Twitter\'s growth rate on users and numbers of tweets was straight up there just now revenues going to catch up with it.

It\'s going to be an awesome company but I never argue with growth so whenever we see a company that\'s growing at a thousand percent a month and in the early days when you\'re successful you will grow at a thousand percent a month because going from one users to 10 users.

But if if they\'re happy users and there\'s word of mouth because Twitter never advertise and there\'s good word of mouth and good PR that\'s the greatest company you can get.

Look at the growth of Google.

Google was the very same way.

 \[00:16:10\] So Twitter you thought basically I don\'t know what this thing is.

The graphs seem to be going about it.

But yeah but it\'s growing which means users like it which means it\'s going to be successful.

 \[00:16:19\] There must be something there because if you look at Google Facebook and Twitter none of them had any idea what the monetization outcome was going to be.

All they focused on was happy users and getting lots of them quickly.

And that ends up that\'s a great strategy.

That\'s what Ben Silverman is doing at Pinterest today.

 \[00:16:40\] They just knew that there was an important problem to be solved and they sort of had faith they would be able to make money somehow of course.

 \[00:16:47\] And now Google is the one who probably took the biggest risk because now Ben can at least look back to Google Facebook and Twitter and say wow they made sure they had like a hundred million happy users and then they thought about monetization and you actually don\'t need to think about monetization that much.

Once you get to 100 million users gives you time to figure out hey wait a minute you know there\'s there\'s ways to turn this into a really viable business.

 \[00:17:16\] So  \[00:17:16\] when Larry and Sergei were starting out doing Google they really didn\'t have they didn\'t know how they were going to make money.

 \[00:17:23\] No not at all.

I still have Google\'s first ten page investor slide deck and you get to the last page and it says thank you it doesn\'t.

 \[00:17:37\] It does not have the spreadsheet that is usually the last page.

 \[00:17:42\] Yeah.

And they were not apologetic about it.

They said we have awesome technology and it will lead to monetization and we\'re not going to tell you something we don\'t know because we don\'t know how we\'re going to monetize it.

They were very honest about it and that was a novel thing in those days that was very novel and that\'s why people misconstrued that as arrogance when in fact Larry and Serguei were just being really bluntly honest with the investors that came in to see them.

They were like hey if you look at our search results and they were so much better than the prior search engine which I was an investor in Ask Jeeves you know if you can\'t figure that out you\'re crazy.

Now I know I figured it out and I knew Ask Jeeves really well the minute we started doing Google searches when we went in to see Larry and Serguei we we said hey can one of our guys play with the search engine.

While I talked to Larry and Sergei and just because Google said we\'re based on relevance and page rank those are really easy words today.

But back in 1997 when you said I have a search engine based on page rank if other people like that page and they they springboard off of that page then that page must be awfully good.

So I\'m going to send more people to the pages that people like.

And and it was all motivated by relevancy.

 \[00:19:20\] So what did you think when you first met them.

Where did you first meet them.

Do you remember.

 \[00:19:24\] Oh of course I do on University Avenue.

They had moved out of the garage in Menlo Park into the office lesy office the lucky office this is where people thought I was.

And then I think danger after that which is now Android was in that one office saw I actually heard about Google through David Cheriton who is a very famous Stanford professor and a founder himself.

We were at a holiday party six months before I actually met Larry and Sergei and I said Hey you\'re on the you\'re in the labs at Stanford.

You know what\'s cooking there.

David was an investor in our fund and we said all of our investors you know a David you can invest in the fund but you got to tell us when you see something interesting so at this Christmas party we were both in tuxedos and we both hate tuxedos.

I said to get our mind off this.

 \[00:20:24\] Tell me about what\'s going on at Stanford to get your mind off the uncomfortable tuxedo.

Yes.

That\'s how it all started.

Yes it did.

 \[00:20:34\] And he said There\'s this company called back Rob.

But they\'re not ready to see you yet but when they are you know all.

I\'ll introduce you.

 \[00:20:43\] Did he say you should invest is going to be the biggest.

Oh yeah.

Edgy company in a decade.

 \[00:20:48\] David Cheriton was the one who said the two magic words page rank and relevance and back in 1997 those were not buzz words.

Those were like hey talk to me about.

And then he explained what what they meant.

 \[00:21:01\] So what did you think of Larry and Sergei when you met him.

Did they seem like they were going to be super successful.

Oh as soon as you met them and this was like a historic historic company.

 \[00:21:11\] Well because we\'ve invested in 650 companies by then it was probably 300 companies in 1997.

You had a good read on entrepreneurs.

And keep in mind for every company we invest in we say no to 30.

So we we see a lot of entrepreneurs.

So what I saw was two on two entrepreneurs that were great scientists but very very strategic and determined.

Because they said to me once they said hey we want you to invest.

They said hey you have to go get Mike Moritz to invest in our company.

So you introduced I introduced you to to Google in that round and ice and I said Hey Mike Mars is a great guy.

Why.

What made you pick him.

Oh he\'s on the board of Yahoo.

And one of the Yahoo search do you get to bootstrap this company.

Because at the time they\'re out of Vista was the search engine they had to displace an incumbent.

And they said to do that we\'ve got to do two.

We\'ve got to do two big OEM deals.

Yahoo\'s one more so arrange that for us if we get em and that happened.

And then they were already talking to John door at that at kepi and I didn\'t have to figure out the door Bpeace door andK.P.

were on the board of AOL.

 \[00:22:37\] And so they got Google and Kleiner in that first round because they were on the boards of AOL and Yahoo respectively.

Yes which is boy.

 \[00:22:45\] Yes.

And that.

OK.

So once they got both to agree to invest then kepi didn\'t want Secoya and Sequoia didn\'t want kepi that took a month of wrangling and Larian Serguei.

You almost got the whole deal you almost got the whole deal ourselves.

After a month Larry and Serguei said.

Now after a month Google is exploding.

You can tell that this is a technology that people are going to use for 50 years.

And Google\'s 14 years old now and Larry and Sergei got exasperated and they called me one Friday and they said hey Yuto the first day I went in there I said hey let\'s do a quick 10 million dollar round all lead it and I\'m an angel investor.

But I knew for this technology we we could round up the money and syndicate that and they said hey you said you said a month ago you can do that can you do it.

I said I can do it by Monday.

And I actually believed it because then I knew even more about the company and the quality of these two founders.

But I did call KPN Sequoia and I said hey these founders are very determined they\'re going to do it with your we\'re not bullshit artists.

They really are telling you it\'s over on Monday.

And I told them why I said I\'m going to do the funding myself.

If you guys can\'t you know get.

 \[00:24:17\] This is this is possibly the most generous moment in the history of Silicon Valley.

Can I just I just not made that call right.

Of course there\'s a lot of people in this venture business who have made the call and said Oh yeah they\'re bullshitting.

 \[00:24:29\] Don\'t worry they have no option except you guys are here.

They know they\'d read about it around here\'s another here\'s another.

 \[00:24:37\] Your wife thinks you\'re crazy.

So so Friday I called John door and Mike Moretz said it\'s over on Monday.

 \[00:24:47\] Sure enough it only took them just Saturday morning.

I know exactly what effect that I got.

 \[00:24:55\] I was sitting in a Starbucks in foster city.

I don\'t know what street it was on.

And I got the calls and I put so close the cell phone and I said to my wife this is history.

And she said really.

I said yes.

The funding of like the biggest company ever is going to happen.

So you knew it you knew it.

I knew it.

Like today is today that they themselves.

 \[00:25:33\] I don\'t always know it.

 \[00:25:36\] Yeah.

You know with Facebook.

That\'s what I wanted to say.

Yeah I I did not get Facebook.

But.

But.

I get growth and growth is the lifeblood of innovation.

And every time I met with Zach and Sean Parker who was the president then I met Facebook through Parker because we had gone through the Napster experience together.

The growth was like this and I said you can\'t argue with metrics every time you met them the numbers were different and they were right way way up to the right and they were doing all the right things.

What did you think of Mark the first time you met him.

I met him at university Cafe in in Palo Alto.

It was just him and I.

Even though Sean Parker introduced us I\'ve never told this before.

You sure you want to.

Yeah.

 \[00:26:38\] OK.

Go ahead.

Number one I think everyone knows Sean Parker is an edgy person.

And so I want to just tell Zuck even though I didn\'t even I had never met Zach.

 \[00:26:50\] Hey your prison is pretty edgy.

 \[00:26:52\] So I just want to tell you that without him here and Zach to his credit said Yeah I have figured that out.

 \[00:27:01\] Zooks 19 years old at the time and Parkers maybe 20 or 21 Parkers probably a few years older than Zach and Zach goes Yeah I figured that out was kind of a rocky start because it was like Oh OK.

So let\'s move and Zack was like let\'s move on.

You know what.

What can you help Facebook do.

And one of the huge things that SUV Angel does is help companies get funded.

We help Google with their funding issue help Twitter with their funding issues especially in the benchmark round.

So did you get involved with Facebook.

DC right.

Oh yeah yeah.

So they had taken the PTO money and they were getting ready to do the V C round.

So and Sean Parker because of Napster knew that as well.

Angel investors at the time that we could really help work with all these vaccines and get them to close around quickly and efficiently because the process can be really painful if you know enough forcing functions you essentially orchestrate a bidding war.

And I with Facebook.

No I did not.

No I we triaged the list of about 20 vaccines that we wanted to go to.

They were already talking to the Washington Post Don Graham Don Graham offered a 50 million valuation and Zerkin Parker called me when they got out of the office.

Ron Ron we got a 50 million dollar valuation from from Don Graham.

I got a go back in.

I don\'t think you heard him right.

I bet she said five million.

Now no he said 50 million.

I said hurry up and get it to happen.

So in this case I didn\'t need to do anything in that process.

Jim Bryer was looking at the company and decided to offer 80 million.

I think it was 80 million pre 90 million post which you know that that was the rebirth of Excel right there after the bubble.

 \[00:29:15\] So Jim where did the funding that was that Google\'s pre money series A Google\'s free money was 75 million free.

Do you think it was a coincidence.

There was a little more at Facebook.

Yeah I would say it\'s a coincidence.

 \[00:29:29\] All right.

If I want to sucker over to take my money I would offer them a little bit more than good.

 \[00:29:37\] Free on brand was it Facebook first.

And I I always felt bad.

And Don Graham was a gentleman about saying hey Excel is offering 30 million more than me.

Excel should be easy and fast forward five years Don Gram\'s on the board of Facebook today which I think is awesome because Don Gramm was a mentor to Mark Zuckerberg in the early days.

Did any BCSC network went and spent two weeks at the post just following Don Graham around while the company was growing like a weed.

Because he wanted to see what a CEO did.

 \[00:30:16\] And he followed suit in the journalism business.

Yeah.

So was I going to ask kind of completely forgotten I was surprised by that.

Oh yes.

Did say no to Facebook in that round yeah any I said no that is not going to work.

Oh no I have the e-mails.

 \[00:30:38\] And I am not naming them.

OK.

Now I want to ask you.

 \[00:30:42\] Privately hey this is really this is really early days.

Yeah.

Did they say no because they didn\'t believe in the business.

What did they say no because the price was too high.

No I did not believe in the business.

This is wacky like the social network for college dude.

Yeah right.

Like who cares.

So let\'s see them do you do you know incidentally what multiple you got on Google.

It was Google Google.

 \[00:31:13\] Goog.

I don\'t think so.

No no.

 \[00:31:21\] Roughly three.

Three hundred to one.

Three hundred.

That\'s right.

If you sold it the all time high you would get like 700 dollars for each dollar you invested.

Some high might be in the future.

Yes the all time high for Google is definitely in the future.

 \[00:31:40\] Do you think Larry and Sergey knew that they were gonna be that big.

 \[00:31:46\] No definitely not.

Which makes me think of a story can I.

Yes.

How are we doing on time.

 \[00:31:55\] We\'re minutes.

You bet.

This is a good story so.

So Ben Horowitz showed his picture with Warren Buffett.

 \[00:32:06\] At a party at my home when he talked.

 \[00:32:09\] It was his first slide.

Iran is running secretly behind everything at that at that they\'re attending that party along with with Ben.

 \[00:32:23\] This party was sponsored by Angel investors at the time which was my fund at the time.

And we had in our yard every internet person known to man including Sean Parker Shawn Fanning and Larry and Serguei.

And it was in 1998.

Let\'s say so google was like one year old Napster probably a year and a half old and the day of this party Napster was at its all time high.

Forty million users Sean Parker has been on the cover of every major magazine in America.

Within three weeks and major magazines in America don\'t put the same guy on the cover.

But Napster was so disruptive they said the hell with it.

This kid\'s got to go on the cover Shawn Fanning is really famous.

He is the shyest person on the Earth not a malicious bone in his body.

He had a keeper with them at the party even though I knew him really well.

He was like You know I don\'t like all this attention.

So Larry Larian Serguei say hey will you introduce us to.

Fanning I golf course I will.

Google is barely known.

Probably a third of the people at this party he would say Google and they\'d say I\'ve heard it good.

You know what do they do.

So I take them off when I say to Fanning I said this will be the biggest company on or some day because their search results are so accurate and so good.

And Fanning is fascinated.

Talks to him shake hands.

We go.

We walk away.

And Larry and Sergei follow me and I go.

Is there somebody else you want to meet.

They go No no we have to talk to you.

They said it is so frustrating.

We will we will never be famous like him.

Laughter.

And they were looking at me like.

Tell us.

Were right.

And I said You guys are so wrong because you\'re going to make money while this guy fights with the record labels.

 \[00:34:42\] Let\'s  \[00:34:42\] not end on that.

No no no.

Won\'t.

And with that we\'ll end with the question everybody in this.

 \[00:34:50\] Well a lot of people in audience probably want to know which is how do they get your money.

Well you makes you want to invest in somebody.

Well we invest in people first.

 \[00:35:00\] There will be people but they they have to they have to be people with personalities with drive they know it\'s 24 by 7.

They have to be a leader because if you\'re going to build a big company you have to have enough charisma to get other people to work on your team.

You\'ve got a Renoir what he\'s saying is yeah.

So Andy termination what what Jessica talked about you you have to be completely fearless.

How can you tell when you meet somebody that they have these qualities.

In fact I want to be doing it so long that I can just tell after 10 minutes I\'ve made up my mind.

So the SVM you I have to keep saying hey I don\'t want to come across as rude but after 10 minutes I\'ve decided if I like the company or not because I\'m looking at the personality of the individual how can they build a great company.

So there\'s like a 50 I\'m an algorithm in my brain that goes through like 50 traits that person\'s got it and you don\'t have this.

I want to invest I don\'t I\'m not I really don\'t care what the company does today.

I want to invest in that entrepreneurs company like their sixth seventh a company.

You know it\'s a lifelong commitment.

I don\'t think other investors look at it that way.

It\'s not very useful advice either you got it or you don\'t.

 \[00:36:37\] No no no no no no no.

I\'m looking for traits that are all identifiable you know.

 \[00:36:42\] Are you a good communicator.

Are you a leader.

Are you driven.

You can tell that when you\'re talking to somebody.

 \[00:36:48\] I suppose the good news is if the person has these traits even if they don\'t think they would necessarily make a good startup founders something like that you\'ll back them while they figure it out.

Of course very well right.

 \[00:36:58\] Yeah that\'s as unique about as V Angel.

The other thing is product focus.

So if you look at the success of Facebook and Pinterest and square these founders are focused on the product and they are focused on the product because they know if the products good they\'re gonna have a happy customer they care almost too much about it.

You clearly never care too much craftsmen who really care.

They are all graphs.

You know in this day and age.

So much of the success is about UI.

So if you look at Ben Silverman Jack Dorsey and Zuck they they care about happy users and in a perfect world they will go back in their Harvel and just make their product great.

They hate coming out in public takes them away from from the brass ring which is millions and millions of happy customers.

 \[00:38:07\] Robert there\'s no Q and A\'s we don\'t win outright on an awkward note.

These press guys a gentleman.

Thanks Ron.
