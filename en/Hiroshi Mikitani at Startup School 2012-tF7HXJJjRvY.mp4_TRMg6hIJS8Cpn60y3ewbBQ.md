**Hiroshi Mikitani at Startup School 2012-tF7HXJJjRvY.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Thank you for coming.

Thank you very much for inviting so many people.

A lot of people.

So maybe the start you could just tell us a little bit about what Rocketdyne is and how you got started.

 \[00:00:09\] OK.

So I found in Iraq then in 1997 as a matter of fact you know I was trying to partner with one of your find a program and you know my concept was to create what we call Internet shopping mall in Japan.

It was very very arty RTD and we tried to do it was full for viruses that didn\'t go through.

So we started to hire you know young graduate school students start it from initial capital of 200000 USD never raise any money from NBC just hired young guys and went public in the year 2010 started to you know by many companies.

Now we\'re number one in e-commerce about 35 to 40 percent market share in terms of e-commerce normally online travel.

Number one in online banking.

 \[00:01:14\] Number two online brokerage and we do about 38 different businesses in Japan.

 \[00:01:22\] And we said to globalize our business so now we\'re in more than 13 countries.

We bought the second largest area in a company called Corbeau which is doing extremely well in Europe and Canada and in Asia.

So we\'re a little bit different Internet company in Japan and now trying to globalize our business.

 \[00:01:52\] How is starting a company in Japan and growing a company in Japan different and Silicon Valley.

Well you know there is no TV venture capital ecosystem.

 \[00:02:05\] There are venture capitalists but not like you know you know a single but a type of food service.

They will invest but not much.

They will not get involved into the management that much.

So just kind of providing the capital.

 \[00:02:27\] So how did you learn the lessons that seasoned Silicon Valley tradition traditionally help entrepreneurs with.

How did you learn how to run a company and grow it.

 \[00:02:35\] I don\'t know how she bases are helping these venture companies because I haven\'t never experienced the way I\'ve a game.

 \[00:02:44\] I find it happening with my own.

 \[00:02:47\] You know the money initial capital was just 200000 USD.

But since I knew that I\'m not going to be funded a huge amount from ABC I create it sort of cash flow system so that I don\'t need to read I on NBC.

We ask our merchant to pay 500 dollars per month but we ask them to pay us six months upfront.

 \[00:03:17\] So from the second months of our service at my company it was cash flow positive cash flow through every month and it was just very impressive.

 \[00:03:32\] Looking back to that first year you know when you were sort of becoming cash flow positive very quickly and figuring this out as you went.

Are there any things that stick out that you would do differently.

Well so ongoing.

 \[00:03:46\] We never raised any money from outside we raise later on from friends and families and we didn\'t need any money but it was kind of just you know for the friendship sake I want to make my family and my friends happy.

 \[00:04:05\] How far along were you when you about friends and family around.

No there was like six months before we go public.

 \[00:04:15\] Two days before our IPO my friend must solve Softbank call me and ask me to let him in.

But I said it\'s too late.

 \[00:04:27\] Well we were very patient.

 \[00:04:30\] To be honest we were a very patient for the first two years and tried to be create the you know Connell of our business model.

 \[00:04:42\] So we\'re not trying to compete with the modelAmazon.com or eBay.

We\'re trying to create a great system to support medium to small sized merchant to sell their product all over Japan.

So we really tried to create an extremely strong culture of the company because I knew that I\'m going to be in this business for a long long time.

So we didn\'t rush really we were very patient.

 \[00:05:12\] Did you figure out that kernel on the first try did you get right.

The thing that made Rocketdyne what it is the first try did you have to iterate and evolve to get.

 \[00:05:19\] Well one thing we did differently from most of space e-commerce company is we try to facilitate communication between the merchants and the consumers because the way I feel is of course you know buying products Price is important.

Efficiency is important but more than that in my opinion by being you know should be fun.

And no we need to create a rich experience.

So we try to be a liason between the consumer and the retailer instead of trying to compete against the retailer using the idea we want to use our technology to help small to medium size enterprise do business with consumers.

So that was totally different idea and I was 100 percent confident my employees will really like the idea of helping small medium size companies rather than trying to destroy their business.

 \[00:06:24\] So I mean as you said this is very different than anyone else was doing in e-commerce at the time really still is.

Did you know that that was going to be the model you\'re going after before you started the company was that we were you convinced that this was what you were going to do differently.

 \[00:06:38\] We didn\'t think about how we would do it differently but we know what we wanted to do.

I always don\'t think about our competitors much because you know you cannot do too many things about Atabay you just need to focus on what you do to improve your service and improve customer satisfaction.

 \[00:06:57\] I think that\'s part of the nature of Japanese companies keep improving improving improving.

 \[00:07:05\] How did you grow both in the early days when you were signing up these small and medium businesses that you wanted to help and then in the later days obviously you made a lot of acquisitions that helped drive growth.

Could you just talk about how you figure out growth along the way.

 \[00:07:19\] Well first we have organic growth and we buy many companies in domestically and internationally domestically.

We created three things one great great brand by the way we have a professional baseball ruffling egos.

And so everybody knows racketing brand even if you don\'t even use internet they know raft and brand we host a TV found tennis tournament.

So we have an extremely strong brand too.

We created the strongest Mindich award program caught up in Sipple points so we can use those points to cross-sell our services and we also created the sort of the consumer database to analyze consumer data and now about eight 80 million.

 \[00:08:12\] So about 90 percent of Internet operations are member we can use our currency points to cross-sell various services through them back to the topic of acquisitions.

 \[00:08:27\] What do you look for when you make an acquisition and how do you integrate into the company into or 10 so that you\'re all one company together.

 \[00:08:34\] So there\'s two types of acquisitions we make.

One is purely geographic expansion to buy a time.

So we bought thatBuy.com in theU.S.

played com UK prime minister in France and we try to use their presence in brand name and their presence and convert their business model to lock them model.

The second type is addition to our ecosystem very chain like COBOL which is not doing as well as in other countries but they\'re very strong.

They have now more market share in Canada and in France and Japan.

 \[00:09:20\] So we need.

We knew that we need a digital books service in our sort of product line up so we know that we can use our membership to facilitate the growth of COBOL business.

 \[00:09:39\] So there is two types geographic expansion and to buy a time and those who addition to our ecosystem.

 \[00:09:47\] And then once you make these acquisitions how do you integrate them into the culture of architecture mission practice and value.

 \[00:09:57\] So before buying a company we talk about our dream and goal and culture and talk over and over and over again before we make acquisitions.

If they don\'t like our culture or our practice or our mission we\'re not going to buy even if you like their service because it doesn\'t make sense to lose the founders and the management of the company.

So we talk over before the closure of the deal.

We talk a lot about those kind of things.

 \[00:10:27\] And what\'s your success rate for acquisitions in terms of good integration on those points.

 \[00:10:33\] Oh it\'s difficult.

 \[00:10:36\] I don\'t know but there\'s still no one you know only one fada we made was we went into China partnering with supply which is the largest search engine company in China but it didn\'t work out well.

So you know we discussed with them and agreed that we should shut the business now and we withdrew from China yet year ago.

 \[00:11:00\] So there is the on the you know the big Vedia I recognize at this moment even more than the sort of the cultural ideas you\'ve talked about.

 \[00:11:16\] You know one thing that I just heard again and again and that Rockton is known for having having a great culture.

Could you talk about how you\'ve held that culture all the way through for the last 15 years as you said.

How do you think about the culture the company needs to be to be successful needs to have to be successful.

 \[00:11:31\] So in my opinion you need to have two things.

One is of course innovation and the second part is operation and innovation is kind of not so difficult to encourage people to be innovative but at the same time if you want a scale you business you need to have a strong operation culture as well and you wanted to achieve strong operational culture.

 \[00:11:58\] You need to have sort of these shared practices and the idea is kind of the framework for managing the company may mean using more numbers and keep your eyes more.

Most likely the entrepreneurs who don\'t like you know just running the numbers but I think be quantitive and any frequentative is also very important.

 \[00:12:31\] So recently you invested in Pinterest.

Can you talk a little bit about how that came together and what you see in Pinterest and how you hope that relationship is going to evolve.

 \[00:12:41\] Well I think Pinterest spoke or just had a phone call with him and I think he was great.

He\'s great.

We like the company and I think Pinterest is very different from other social networks.

It\'s very you know graphical and appeals to the heart of your interest and has a strong influence over to buying behavior and buying the shoes of the people.

So as an e-commerce company I think Pinterest is the best social network.

So we found Pinterest and I had a meeting with Ben Dring in Cairo.

 \[00:13:18\] And he liked me.

He let us in.

 \[00:13:27\] What I think maybe you should ask them.

 \[00:13:30\] But he he still I think he had seen something different in us you know compared with otherU.S.

based Internet companies so if he says I will ask him what do you see as the big challenges and the opportunities in retail and e-commerce coming down over the next few years.

 \[00:13:50\] Of course you know I think this is to the siege stage one for e-commerce.

Now we are seeing lots of decent content sales so they bookC.D DVD games everything will be digital and online Difford into the logistics will become more and more important.

And there are lots of innovative logistics company you know using robots and automation to you know improve the efficiency and also the devices the mobile phones smartphones.

The tablet will become the major device to buy products and maybe there will be a sort of social.

I think these social shopping is still Milbury fine.

The strong answer to it.

 \[00:14:46\] But I think in the future it will call for social shopping or anything else.

Are there major ways you identified the Japanese consumers behave differently than consumers anywhere else in the world.

 \[00:14:57\] Well Knapton is what I call a shopper centric marketplace meaning that every shop has a very different characters and so the design and the user experience and we provide all sorts of tools for them to make fans around shop.

 \[00:15:21\] So I think Rapidan was very social from day one.

We try to create a fans around shops not our own rocket and still that JP the fans around shops and all these shops as well you know professional staff and they are the sort of curator of wines or sports goods or you know groceries and so forth.

 \[00:15:43\] So I think my question is if you want to buy some product do you want to ask your friend or do you want to ask the staff at the pro shop and my.

Of course sometimes your friend is can give you a bit of advice then staff at the brushoff but most time you know I think you should ask professionals.

So that was our approach and I think it worked extremely well in Japan and now we\'re testing in other countries and I think it\'s it\'s working very well as well.

 \[00:16:19\] Can you talk you talked a little bit about mobile and tablets but obviously in Japan that\'s become a huge way that people are probably even bigger than here where it seems like own right on the phone all the time.

How much are you thinking about mobile and how you\'re thinking about mobile as sort of the future of the company.

 \[00:16:34\] Well already 25 percent of Rockton transaction which is big.

We do about 15 billion USD or even more this year just for pure e-commerce in Japan and already 25 percent of actually is coming from mobile devices including future Volhynia smartphone.

Maybe a 60 percent smartphone 40 percent feature phone and smartphone transaction is growing about 300 to 400 percent year on year.

So it will be more than 50 percent in a couple of years.

 \[00:17:12\] It\'s  \[00:17:12\] huge.

 \[00:17:14\] That is huge.

You said something earlier that was so interesting to me I made a note to go back to it which is that you don\'t think a lot about competition because you can\'t do much about that.

One thing that I hear from startups all the time is Fearby competition.

So when you were starting the company and Amazon and eBay were were huge.

Was that a problem for you.

Did people ask you what are you going to do about Amazon and eBay.

You know how are you going to beat them how you can be with them and how do you think about sort of how did you stay focused on doing your own thing and ignoring competition.

 \[00:17:46\] Well let me put it I learn from the competitors but I\'m not afraid of competitors because even if you are afraid of it doesn\'t do any good for you.

I learned what they\'re doing and then maybe you know try to match if I have to.

 \[00:18:05\] But I think the the way we approach e-commerce is totally different fromAmazon.com because again we try to facilitate the transaction is medium to small margins to the larger ones to the consumers.

As a consequence you know we have big brands almost old department store as big a big fashion brands almost entire Tahnee companies are using our platform.

And that\'s a major portion of our business but approaches to how to help small to medium size merchants to do business with consumers.

So.

 \[00:18:52\] I think we have a philosophical difference between ourselves andAmazon.com So I\'m not very afraid of them but I\'m always thinking about how we can scale.

 \[00:19:03\] Our business holding on time but the way I see what\'s so interesting here we\'re talking a little bit backstage about just sort of Japanese culture and the differences between starting a startup here and we talk about investing.

Could you talk about hiring and how you hired the initial people and especially in a culture where joining a startup is not as cool as it was making it now as it is in the valley.

 \[00:19:32\] Well now of course it\'s different from 50 years ago when I started a company you know nobody wanted to work for small startups but now they have seen many successes and there are so many young people who want to work for the startups and ventures and so forth.

 \[00:19:56\] I think the way I mean hiring younger people and not to higher the mid to upper age people as much as possible because I knew that we wanted to embrace our older you know corporate culture.

 \[00:20:16\] So it was very important for me to hire young people and educate them especially in 90 days after we went public.

We started to hire many Lobethal gray gray hair people and you know because we need that we need more professional expertise.

And two and a half years ago we announced that we are going to convert dunnhumby Kishen language from Japanese to English.

 \[00:20:42\] And this was a big splash in the Japanese society and some CEOs that you know you know explicitly announce that we are crazy company as we are but now 70 percent of new engineers joining us are no Japanese.

30 percent of the new employees are not Japanese so we had to equal mobilizing our recruitment.

 \[00:21:08\] Mark Zuckerberg a few years ago made a comment about hiring young people preferentially and it was all that the press talked about for two weeks so maybe you\'ll be featured a lot.

 \[00:21:18\] Now I\'m talking alone.

 \[00:21:22\] Why did you make that decision to make English the official language of the company.

Well so the thing I have done in Japan is each side to create an open culture company so we disclose almost all information to entire employees.

So we\'re the people who is doing e-commerce know what\'s going on for our banking business.

And we of course share all these expertise and platforms as much as possible you know web marketing engineering and so forth and so forth.

So that was our strengths.

How common is that for Japanese companies to do to share everything openly.

Well sharing the opening up is very common and we call this Yohko then meaning a horizontal transfer of expertise.

 \[00:22:12\] I think this is one of the strengths of Japanese company because it\'s not good or bad.

It\'s not performance oriented Nevius system.

And I wanted to do this globally but I couldn\'t because most of the expertise is in Japan and our most of our stuff cannot communicate in English.

 \[00:22:34\] So you know I was kind of a liason between our global business and Japanese business and that was getting me tired just know talking you know and being Shazli doing everything.

And so one day I woke up and thought about everything in English.

And so I stood in front of entire Simonson\'s employees and told them I\'m going to convert the.

Show business language show adopting from Japanese to English.

 \[00:23:05\] What was the reaction in that room.

 \[00:23:06\] It was a very quiet very quiet but as told that he changed the score of employees improve almost 200 points for the last two years what\'s called an English test.

And most of the staff can manage to communicate in English.

They\'re afraid of going abroad or joining the international conference.

Now we have so many people you know known Japanese foreigners in Tokyo office and now they starting to benchmark international players instead of domestic players so they changed.

 \[00:23:50\] That\'s great.

One last question.

We were talking backstage and the last time that Paul and Mickey met was 16 or 17 years ago when Paul was working on the web.

So Paul loves to ask people these what was someone like the first time you met them.

 \[00:24:06\] So finally we get asked what program is like.

 \[00:24:10\] So it\'s a reading the Harvard Business School case so initially I went after I left my bank I started sort of a business consulting firm and I was looking for something new to do.

And you know I came up with the internet shopping idea and one of my classmate hovers at school call me Mickey you needed look at this company it\'s called bio web and it\'s my friend\'s company.

So I went viaWeb.com and look at me like that next day.

I put the economy class airplane ticket and flew over to Boston and I went for.

And it was five people company.

And we kind of as we said we\'re going to do things together but the last minute Paul was supposed to come over to Japan at the airport.

He found out that his passport has expired.

 \[00:25:08\] And somehow the deal didn\'t go through.

So I feel that was really the first moment I fell.

 \[00:25:18\] I met the tudi strong entrepreneur and I feel the excitement and energy in Paul and he and his team.

 \[00:25:29\] That was great note and thank you very much.

Thank you.
