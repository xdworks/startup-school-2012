**Travis Kalanick at Startup School 2012-rQ6GoY2\_Ujw.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Wow this is awesome.

OK.

This place is full.

All right.

So good to meet all of you My name\'s Travis Kalanick co-founder CEO of Uber.

Let\'s see so I do a lot of speaking because we are we\'re a technology company that is we\'re in the trenches we\'re in the cities you know more than half of our employees are not in San Francisco.

And I almost I don\'t even remember the last time I spoke in San Francisco in front of an audience.

Every time I go to speak somewhere I look I go on Google and I look at the roads I look at architecture I look at cool pictures I input that are iconic.

I\'m going to speak in Silicon Valley.

I\'m searching google images and I can\'t find anything.

And so yeah there you go.

It\'s good to be here laughter.

And it was I found a little something.

All right.

So guys I\'m guessing most people here at least know what Uber is.

But for those of you who don\'t I\'m going to go do sort of a basic tour just really quick.

It\'s an app on your iPhone that helps you get a car.

Our motto is everyone\'s private driver and so you.

You open up the app and you see a bunch of cars that are near you.

This is one of the San Francisco cars three minutes away.

And GM will arrive in two minutes.

He\'s rated a four point eight.

And this is of course all screen shots from your app.

When he arrives you\'re told you\'re notified in call the driver of course and if you\'re lucky he\'ll open the door for you when you\'re done.

This is a short trip.

Fifteen dollars that\'s our minimum in San Francisco.

Of course we have lower cost options.

Now we have something called Uber axe a couple days ago we launched taxi in San Francisco for a lot of folks are like you\'re doing taxes here the anti taxi what are you doing.

We know what we\'re doing.

But laughter we\'ll get to that in just a second.

All right.

So some basics launched in June 2010.

So we\'re we\'re just over two years old.

We don\'t own cars we don\'t employ drivers.

A lot of people don\'t know that about us.

They think we we have all these assets.

They think that we employ lots of cars we don\'t have 120 employees most of which are not in San Francisco.

We don\'t have a marketing spend.

We\'re deployed in 17 cities for some reason they\'re 16 here.

We actually just softe launched in Sydney a couple days ago actually yesterday.

Amsterdam is coming very very shortly.

And I think Minneapolis\'s and on here we did that a couple weeks ago.

So quick numbers hundreds of thousands of hours driven per week.

Very interesting engagement figure 50 percent of all the people who have ever written on Uber have ridden in the last 30 days.

And remember when you ride your pain.

So think about commerce.

About e-commerce site or our ecommerce app or 50 percent of the people who\'ve ever paid paid in the last 30 days.

Average person is paying about 105 dollars a month in San Francisco is a bit higher than that.

Prices are probably a bit too high.

I know some of you felt that sting.

We\'re doing 26 percent month over month growth.

That\'s an average over the last now 16 17 months.

You go OK.

Well if you start really low then you can grow really big but we\'re pretty big.

Twelve months ago and if you do 26 percent month over month growth that means in 12 months you\'re 16 times bigger than you were four months ago.

So we\'re growing fast and in fact September over August was 29 percent month over month.

So I want to tell a little bit about our background and then hopefully if I have enough time get into some of the regulatory stuff which I know none of you guys want to hear about.

All right.

So this you can\'t see really well because of all the lights but it\'s a romantic shot from the Eiffel Tower between with me and my co-founder Gary camp some you guys may Noam Hughesy founder stumble upon.

It was in Paris at Le Web where we came up with this idea essentially you know he said look I just want to push a button and get a ride.

You know let\'s and let\'s make it a classy ride.

And that\'s kind of how we started.

Paris in many ways is a sister city of San Francisco.

Impossible to get a cab there.

So this is something from the past.

This is what we call Halee.

I\'m not sure if you guys have ever done that but some people actually put their arm out to get a cab.

I don\'t I don\'t know what\'s going on.

It\'s a weird thing but this is what we used to see in San Francisco.

I went through that when we first started actually it wasn\'t about taking over the world it wasn\'t about taking on corruption in every city around the world.

It was actually just about being baller in San Francisco.

And the only way to do it.

The original idea was let\'s go buy 10 EST classes.

 \[00:05:10\] Let\'s hire 20 drivers and let\'s get a parking garage.

And I\'m like Garrett we\'re not buying any car Stu and we\'re not signing any lease on a parking garage.

But the idea of pushing a button and getting a ride in within minutes was a magical one.

And at the beginning it was a lifestyle thing.

It was as classes for us and our hundred friends.

And so that\'s where it started.

In order to use the app anybody could download it but in order to use it you had to have a special code that I gave you.

And pretty soon the inbox was just getting full of people who wanted the code because our friends were telling their friends and then you know I searched on Google images is my favorite thing.

 \[00:05:50\] Explosive viral growth on the Internet.

And there you go.

That was the best one I could find.

We have this thing called God view.

This is an older version of God.

You can see much more what\'s going on today but I can\'t show you the new version of God.

It\'s too intense.

But this is a screenshot of a Friday night.

Very soon after we launch maybe a few weeks or something like that we had four trips going on at the same time we were going nuts.

For trips like we got trips going on we got to dispatch the green line at the top there.

That\'s a dispatch.

He shouldn\'t have his arm up but he does but he\'s got to he\'s got a little briefcase which is cool.

That\'s Friday night early on in.

Now this is 5:00a.m.

on a Monday.

 \[00:06:45\] The eyeballs by the way you see some eyeballs.

Every once in a while in there that\'s somebody opening an app.

So we see when people open apps that helps us in demand prediction.

Remember we\'re a logistics company or what I\'d call it.

We were building an urban logistics fabric.

So when you do something successful.

Not everybody\'s happy.

And the older the industry you are tackling the the more protected it is by government or by corruption or by both the more they\'re going to be upset about what you do.

We\'re making drivers lives a hell of a lot better they\'re making a lot more money they\'re making ends meet they\'re living their American dream.

And Uber is helping them do that.

Riders are getting around town much more efficiently I\'m not sure who hurts from this other than a particular incumbent industry which I would mention.

 \[00:07:39\] So a few metrics look when I\'m having a bad day I just go to our overall revenue graph laughter.

 \[00:07:55\] This is a cool trick in Photoshop if you take that image and you flip it.

It\'s like a smile.

OK.

All right.

That\'s just gratuitous.

OK.

Look we launched in Sanford.

Oh by the way.

So this.

This is what.

26 percent month over month growth looks like and many times when I show this when I when I do presentations in cities every time we launch in a city we do this big launch event sort of have some high rollers and people who really make the city move.

We sort of pay our respects to that city and and do a really nice dinner.

And these folks are always leaning to the left looking for the Axis.

When we first launched first a lot of people go wow it\'s successful it\'s so obvious I call it the the hand to the palm to foresaid moment when they learn about Uber they\'re like I had this idea or I should have had this idea.

When we first launched guys it wasn\'t easy getting our angel around.

People thought we were crazy limos in San Francisco.

But it took off like I said.

And so one of the interesting things before we went to our series they are sorry this is actually before our series be here which we did in November of last year.

Was is this a one hit wonder or not is this only going to work in San Cisco because it\'s so screwed up.

And so we start launching in other cities and this is a revenue chart on a weekly it\'s a weekly window which you could think of as like almost a moving average blue is San Francisco yellow is New York.

 \[00:09:34\] This is early on the brown is Seattle and the green there Chicago obviously we\'re way past that.

Now this is like sort of the first 100 days.

But what we found is that every city we were rolling out would just say hey we didn\'t know it was going to work.

Every city we were rolling out got progressively better.

Our operation side of the house got very efficient and then the technology and the number of people who knew about when we go in we went in to New York.

We had a thousand people with credit cards on file without a car on the ground.

 \[00:10:06\] So this wasn\'t a one hit wonder and so we just started launching a ton of cities and we have this double rainbow of metrics.

What does it mean.

Remember as liquidity goes up this is you know people in the market place who are building a marketplace know what liquidity means that means demand and supply go up together if they don\'t have a marketplace.

In our world as liquidity goes up the quality of the experience goes up and it dramatically.

Right.

So our average pickup times in San Francisco two minutes and 45 seconds when we first started in New York we\'re like 12 minute average pickup times and let me tell you you don\'t want to be delivering 12 minute pickup times to New Yorkers.

They will kick your ass.

Laughter.

So as it gets better now we\'re right around five minutes in New York and that\'s kind of when they lose their minds.

As more people use it you go from the core user base to bigger.

The engagement actually gets deeper the number of rides per rider per month actually go up as we expand as a cool cohort graph.

But who cares.

The bottom line is that 50 percent of the people who ever use still use and we\'ve seen that from the beginning.

This is an interesting one.

This is San Francisco indexed revenue.

So we\'re gettin there\'s lots of town cars in San Francisco right.

The number of town cars that there were in San Francisco before we got there was 600.

There are now more cars dedicated to Uber than there were town cars in San Francisco when we got there.

And so you\'re like well this thing\'s going to slow down this train is going to slow down at some point.

We indexed San Francisco revenue from last year due July 1st through the end of the year and looked at this year July 1st to where we are now and it\'s tracking almost identical.

So it\'s not slowing down any time soon and when you\'re talking about for a particular city 20 percent month over month growth that\'s that\'s really big growth especially when you\'re when the numbers are getting big.

So on the operations side I think a lot of us are techies.

You know I\'m an engineer by training.

We know what product managers are we know what that means but when you\'re on the ground when your technology touches people and it touches cities what you have to do is have process managers process managers or similar product managers they manage the process that people do versus machines and the roadmap for product has to dovetail with the roadmap for process because any time we change anything that happens in a car that\'s got to change the tack and vice versa.

So it\'s really interesting mapping processes that we go through.

 \[00:12:56\] Come on.

 \[00:12:58\] This is supposed to be a picture of Europe.

We\'re rolling out very big in Europe right now so getting the operational expertise.

I think this just isn\'t talked a lot about in startups is the operations side of the business.

I think a lot of e-commerce companies see that we see it on a very deep level because you know the rubber\'s actually meeting the road but getting teams ready to roll out in Europe is something we\'ve been spending time in Paris and London right now.

Like I said we\'re gonna be in Amsterdam very soon and there\'s a whole host of other cities that were that are lined up in Europe and that\'s going to be a big push.

And this year also in the first half of next year we have somebody in Asia ready to go and city sort of our first city in Asia Pac and I can\'t wait to go to a launch party.

OK.

So quality and choice.

It was really interesting right.

We had this high end thing it\'s costs about 50 percent more than a cab.

And everybody said oh there\'s high end and everybody goes wow I\'m going to do a low cost Uber.

There\'s like a few companies out there I can remember their names that decide they\'re going to be a low cost to run they clone our app.

You know they flatter us by basically stealing all the pixels and copying them over to their app.

Uber Edwy Uber is going to be a low cost Uber but it\'s about quality and choice and what we see when we low when we roll out a low cost option.

What we see is that actually engagement gets deeper because people have choice they don\'t have to always get the expensive thing so they start using it more often people who maybe wouldn\'t start with the black car products start with taxi or what we call Uber X and then it\'s date night and they will improve.

You know they want to impress their lady or they just need a comfortable ride.

And it goes from there.

So this was a choice a beautiful thing let\'s keep moving taxi we did in Chicago in April.

We now have a few cities were in Boston Toronto Chicago San Francisco we were in New York BOPA.

 \[00:15:08\] Not anymore.

Don\'t get me started.

Fair enough we\'ll get to that at the end.

We did Uber acts which is sort of like a low end Uber where we did this in July in San Francisco in New York and that\'s where it\'s basically 30 percent cheaper.

All hybrid fleet at least inS.F.

where we\'re starting to diversify a little bit out of hybrids because we can\'t get the partners to buy cars fast enough.

But the thing is as you push a button and a car appears in five minutes and feels magical but how you make that happen is actually very complex.

So we have a math department here.

I like to tell them I say look guys you\'re in charge of our margins right because they need to get the pickup times really low but the utilization really high.

How do you do that right.

Well you do that through a lot of math.

Let\'s start with our math department.

Okay that\'s not my math department.

We have two nuclear physicists on staff.

Computational neuroscientist a machine learning expert and a few other guys there.

They\'re killing it and some of the things they do.

They do demand prediction congestion prediction supply matching supply positioning smart dispatch algorithms dynamic pricing Friday and Saturday night or special nights.

We sometimes get really big waves of demand that you can\'t really get enough cars to do anything about.

So you have a marketplace oriented sort of dynamic pricing element that clears the market it gets more cars on the road and in sort of lassoes in sort of uncontrollable demand.

You can\'t see these pictures really well because of the lights but they\'re pretty these are some heat maps of cities.

This isD.C.

right here.

But you guys probably can\'t see it.

This is Manhattan.

Can\'t you tell.

Anyways these are useless.

I\'ll just keep going.

Okay.

All right.

This right here is what drivers see.

This is our supply positioning so in our company when mass goes operational that becomes how am I doing on time by the way.

I have no timing here.

Eight minutes left.

All right.

Minutes left.

All right.

This is going to suck.

All right.

All right.

So supply positioning right we have a heat map of demand but we basically were predicting demand 20 minutes ahead of time.

The problem is is that if I gave the heat map to drivers they\'ll all go to the same spot and then they\'ll be bad for a lot of people who aren\'t in that hot spot.

So what we do is we say here\'s the heatmap of demand or prediction for 20 minutes time.

But where is the supply right now that\'s anti heat that sucks the heat out of the map what\'s left over is residual heat underserved demand.

And we do down neighborhood by neighborhood basis will ultimately go continuous on it.

The math is very tricky and complex and computationally intensive but that gives you a sense of some of the things we do that\'s in car you don\'t see it because once you get in the car he\'s on trip and he didn\'t see that map anymore.

Dynamic pricing.

I talked a little bit about that already.

We have one of our nuclear physics guys is a big San Francisco Giants fan.

Clearly we have to look at events in the city because that affects demand in a big way.

When the Giants play of course demand is huge.

When the Giants win it\'s much huger than when they lose Pyong go on style.

You know they want to go the bars.

They\'re just feeling good.

Actually what\'s interesting is in Boston when they lose when the Red Sox lose we actually have bigger demand laughter.

 \[00:18:53\] No joke.

 \[00:18:54\] Here\'s what\'s really interesting.

It\'s not enough to make money.

I just gave way the punch line.

But basically that huge uptick in demand when that when the giant San Francisco Giants win starts about three hours before the game begins.

 \[00:19:11\] Hubers Vegas is going to take on a whole new meaning.

Laughter.

 \[00:19:15\] OK.

So I\'ma really speed through here and this sucks because there\'s so much cool regulatory stuff I have talked about.

But giving riders high fives look transportation and thought of as a boring space it\'s boring.

Well until you push a button and a car magically appears.

But we basically have lots of people love us and how do we get them to tell that story over and over again given an excuse to tell the uber story.

So we do a lot of creative things.

I think a lot of you guys have seen that.

But look Valentine\'s Day we distribute tens of thousands of roses to thousands of drivers every girl who got on a car after 4pmp.m.

was handed a rose by the driver.

That\'s a strong move.

 \[00:19:57\] Fellahs laughter.

 \[00:20:01\] I call it I call this scaling romance on Presidents Day inD.C.

We did what we call an uber Kate K escalated towncar escalate American flags all the way down to one out of every 20 people that push the button and uber kid rolls up laughs the driver the driver has an earpiece that makes him look like Secret Service.

 \[00:20:37\] And as you\'re driving through town kids are like waving like knocking on the window.

Laughter.

 \[00:20:44\] Laughter.

We did something in we did something in South by Southwest.

We got pedicabs as you know into a town car south by.

That\'s just do she like don\'t do that but a pedicab.

Let\'s do this right.

So we did that.

That\'s cool 100 pedicabs you push a button pedicab takes you where you want to go.

But we took 10 of those pedicabs and we outfitted them with these containers that could hold Texas barbecue.

So we did On-Demand Texas barbecue you pushed the button and a cow would come to you on the map.

We did ice cream in July.

And every time we roll out a city we do what\'s called rider zero the first person to get in an uber when we saw lunch.

It used to be an organic thing it just happened and then them my city team started get excited.

This is Edward Norton taking the first.

We were in Los Angeles to go surfing so we give riders high fives but we give drivers hugs and that\'s because look the riders you know they think it goes well they get to their business meeting on time with the Nostrand a certain part of town.

But for a driver who\'s scrapping maybe has a few hours in the morning and one or two hours in the evening or in the afternoon booked filling out that time with a consistent revenue stream helps him make ends meet.

And so you go from just barely making ends meet to really making a living and then investing in your business.

We have drivers who\'ve gone from one car to 15.

Each of those cars grossing more than 100 grand a year.

So these guys are living their American dream.

This is Riadh.

He actually was hustling one of our engineers early on our engineers were getting unlimited Uber.

He\'s like I got it.

We\'re cool but why don\'t you come join Uber.

He did.

He\'s the highest performing driver on the system he makes 20 to 30 percent more per hour most productive driver on the system than all the other drivers.

He also is the highest rated driver.

We saw him figured out how he does what he does.

He now has five cars on the system.

He recently had his first born son named his son after engineer it\'s not funny.

Like that\'s for real.

All right.

This is Honny.

He\'s a comedian been in the city for about 25 years.

He or he thinks of himself as a comedian.

Every time I get in the car he tells me I used to be a Chippendale\'s dancer.

Laughter.

This is Steve Zee\'s and guys just a signal when I\'m running out of time.

I have no idea.

I\'ll go over and spend an hour up here if you let me two minutes.

OK.

All right Steve zis has 15 or sorry 20 cars on the system.

He started with one.

He\'s got five kids told me at 16 going on a 16 on the way.

That\'s funny I said Steve six kids you\'re crazy.

What are you doing.

That\'s nuts.

You\'ve got a business to run.

He\'s like I got I got to keep the uber uber fleet growing.

Laughter.

His son there doesn\'t look too happy to be part of the uber fleet.

Well I could talk about regulation.

I\'d spend a couple minutes.

The bottom line is I can\'t go through a bunch of slides because I really don\'t have the time.

Well on a let\'s just go until somebody stops saying this is a new york city medallion.

That\'s the license to basically own and operate a single taxi in New York.

The number of taxis or medallions in New York it\'s the blue bar there the dark blue.

It\'s basically been flat since 1946 the same number of taxis that were in the city in 1946 is the same number of taxis that are out there today.

That value of that Medinas worth about a million dollars a pop.

There are 13000 medallions in the city of New York.

So you have 13 billion dollars directed at keeping Uber from being successful.

DC We had a really interesting situation.

We went there by the way we\'re as far as we could tell we were totally legal like love legal nicest laws in the country in terms of sedans inD.C.

butD.C.

taxi commissioner goes out there and says Hubers not legal.

Because they charge by time and distance.

And let\'s just say that was real.

Why is charging by distance evil.

I don\'t understand.

I don\'t get it.

But he said look you\'re charged my time and distance you\'re not allowed.

Well we looked at the law.

The law says sadhana for hire vehicle designed to carry fewer than six passengers would charge for service on the basis of time and mileage.

Like what are you time I was going public forms watching postetc.

We go the attorney general in the District of Columbia.

And that\'s what he tells us.

 \[00:25:26\] Laughter So when you read about the crazy stuff we\'re doing in the cities and I\'ve got to close this down some he\'s going to have the hook and they\'re going to take me off here.

 \[00:25:40\] But when you read about the crazy stuff that we\'re doing in the cities know that it is corrupt out there know that we are highly highly disruptive in what you read in the papers isn\'t always true.

And the bottom line is that in order to be in this business in order to be this disruptive to what\'s going on you have to have you have to be willing to fight and you have to not be.

You can\'t be shy.

So it gives you a little bit about it.

Basically they tried to put a floor on our prices I\'ll leave it at this one this last one here.

They put a floor on our prices or tried to pass what they called the uber amendment make our prices five times out of a taxi.

They rolled the amendment out July 10th as of Monday sorry July 9th.

The vote on the bill was the tenth sorry.

 \[00:26:34\] They put the bill out on the 9th that was a Monday at 4:00p.m.

to vote on at 11:00a.m.

the next day 18 hours most of which are going to be sleeping.

I wrote an e-mail to our consumers letting them know that they\'re about to do this.

And by the way the rationale was to ensure that basically we don\'t compete.

If a CEO of a company told said something like this they\'d be in jail.

But if you corrupt your politicians and then push those laws down it\'s totally legal.

Anyways we did something called Life Liberty and the pursuit of membranous Uber DC law was a hashtag 18 hours later.

We had 50000 original e-mails.

 \[00:27:08\] These weren\'t robo e-mails that went to city council people Tynemouth to vote for it.

37000 tweets 104 million social media impressions and we won as you might imagine there wasn\'t a lot of sleep during that time but it was so short it maybe didn\'t matter.

So anyways guys I think the bottom line.

I\'ve got so much stuff Vegas by the way gambling and prostitution illegal legal in Vegas but Hubers not.

I got so much stuff probably have to end this.

I\'ll just end with just a couple more slides here guys and I\'m sorry about this.

Look technology\'s wiring up the core services and city life right here being a bunch other companies they\'re changing not just tech not just your Twitter app.

They\'re changing how you live but that change used to happen over decades is now happening over months.

Quality of Life is not red it\'s not blue.

It\'s just people right.

Cities that resist are going to feel backwards and their cities were not in.

They feel backwards.

All right a lot of our customers who are used to this go.

Others say it doesn\'t work.

So I asked the mayor what are you protecting.

Who are you protecting knowing realize they just don\'t even realize that they\'re protecting they think the taxi industry think drivers know you\'re actually screwing over drivers.

So cities need transportation alternatives but they need modern accountable convenient stylish and efficient ones.

We\'re out there in a city near you guys and look I appreciate being here is a lot of fun.

And thank you.
