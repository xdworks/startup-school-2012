**Tom Preston Werner at Startup School 2012-mGTpU5XUAA8.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Hi everyone.

It\'s awesome to be back here with here in 2010.

Two years ago what\'s changed since then.

I\'m actually going to put this on the ground.

This is my timer.

You see part of being a founder of a company is solving your own problems.

So I was thinking about this talk and what I would talk about what were the big questions would be for me about get hub where we\'ve been and where we go and what does it mean to to start a company today.

And I figured most of you and especially after watching Ben\'s talk might be asking how do II as a budding entrepreneur raise 100 million dollars just like get up did.

Maybe that\'s the question that you\'re that you\'re wondering pretty much anywhere I go now.

Everyone says hey Tom how\'s it going.

What do you guys spend a million dollars on but this I think is the wrong question.

I\'m actually going to tell you how to do that.

I\'m going to tell you something different.

And I think that\'s because at the end of the day money isn\'t actually what matters.

Money is irrelevant.

What is money.

 \[00:01:17\] Money is just a number in some banks computer that says how many slides you can buy for your office.

Right but that\'s not what we care about.

That\'s not what we\'re trying to do here.

We\'re not trying to just make more slides happen in the world.

 \[00:01:34\] So what does matter.

I think what matters is not the money.

Other things.

So let\'s let\'s think about this.

 \[00:01:44\] I forgot my clicker.

I need my clicker.

This is going to be less impactful if I don\'t have my my thing.

OK.

Thank you sir.

Hey you guys are in for a treat.

Okay.

Now that I have this.

OK.

So let me let me let me make a posit and me posit something for you guys.

A company is nothing except the decisions that it makes decisions are made by people.

And with me so far so the only thing that matters are people.

People are the only thing that matters and those people then had better be the right people.

So let me tell you about get a job in the very early days get hub was started by myself and my co-founder Chris wants to off.

Initially there was two of us.

What I did was the design the front end the very that just the visual and the axe.

I also did the very back end which is how rails code Access\'s get repositories on disk so I\'m kind of this weird creature and then I do the front end stuff and I do the back end stuff but I\'ve been doing rails for a long time before that and I didn\'t really like it really like rails.

You can tell the world and I actually like rails out much.

And so I was through you know being in the Ruby community and going to Ruby meet ups this is how I found my co-founder and Chris Strath was very big into rails he had a blog post that outlined everything about how to be the best Rails developer you can be.

Everything about it was amazing.

I said this is a guy that I can start a company with because we have complementary skills.

I\'ll do the front and back and he\'ll do the middle part and together we have the whole thing.

And that worked out really well we just started hacking on it on the side side project.

But then shortly thereafter.

And here\'s here\'s a little tidbit about how can you tell whether your startup idea is actually gaining traction.

How is it how do you how can you tell people enjoy it.

One thing that was really effective for us was when people came to us in the private beta phase and they asked Can I pay for this.

We had no billing system and yet they wanted to pay for it.

They wanted to make sure that it would continue to exist so that it would continue to solve their problems.

So if you have customers asking you to pay for your company\'s product before you can even sell it to them that\'s a good sign.

So in order to accomplish this in order to get this company to a place where people could actually buy it.

We hired our third co-founder.

He came on board was just a few months after we had started and he has his first thing built the billing system.

PJ Hiatt so now we had two rails guys essentially and misto doing front and back and we\'re building out a better mix of people and skills to accomplish what we need to do to get done.

Our first employee that we hired named Scott cone he is a get expert.

So we reached a level in the company where we kind of maxed out our knowledge none of us were really get experts and yet we\'re building the site get Hubb which is for hosting get repositories.

So again through meet ups we met Scott we talked to him we talked him about product about how he would go about building things and he was the one that built just which is the snippet sharing site.

He built from scratch as his first task bringing his knowledge into the equation.

And so you can see are assembling a broader diversity of people who can accomplish more things.

We max out our Get knowledge.

Let\'s bring someone in that can augment that.

And you\'ll notice that none of these people none of the four of us were businesspeople.

None of us had ever really gone into business all that much.

I\'d done some consulting but that doesn\'t really count.

None of us had created large businesses.

None of us had an MBA background or a business background like that.

So none of us either were executives.

None of us had this really broad experience in creating a company that you might as as a person starting out think well how are we going to solve this problem.

Well let\'s let\'s hire an executive because they know what they\'re doing.

Now you have two problems.

Here\'s the thing.

There are executives and they\'re awesome great people but they know so much they know so much that it can be detrimental I think to a startup where you\'re really trying to solve a new problem in a different way.

You have to come to problems with beginner\'s mind not knowing something can be a very powerful tool into accomplishing it because you don\'t know that it\'s not possible.

That\'s what doing a startup is not realizing that something is impossible and doing it anyway.

Something else that was a commonality between us the people in get hub in the earliest days was having worked for bad companies before having worked in places where they did things wrong examples of how not to do something are just as good as examples of how to do something.

And I think this is what companies are for.

Companies solve problems.

Great companies solve real problems and if you haven\'t ever experienced problems then how can you know what are the right ones to solve.

So you\'re all here to do startups to join startups to create startups.

I think that if your options are create a startup or try and you know go work for another company going on working for other companies is not so bad because it gives you this really excellent perspective on things to not do actually.

So getting experience elsewhere.

Not so bad right.

A lot of great people start startups had a bunch of full time jobs before that.

I had five.

I had five full time jobs before starting get a job.

So suffering can sometimes lead to a better product for having that information.

Something that\'s great with people is getting together we would meet for beers all the time and we\'d talk over the problems that we had.

We\'d go to a bar called O\'Reilly\'s up in North Beach San Francisco and we\'d just talk through the big problems right.

People are very important having the same ideas for the product direction is important.

Getting on the same page for that stuff is going to allow you to push forward.

If you find yourself in a situation where you\'re not getting along with your cofounders or the very small team that you\'ve created to begin with really step back and evaluate that problem because I don\'t think you can push forward effectively if you\'re fighting each other.

Look at that.

You should be getting along if you\'re not really really think about what that means.

Hiring is hard.

Hiring the right people is incredibly hard.

Sometimes you\'ll screw it up.

We hired a sales person in the very early days and we had to let him go because he wasn\'t the culture fit it was because we hadn\'t had experience with that kind of hiring before.

And that\'s OK.

You\'re going to screw up hiring.

You have to be in a place mentally where you can fix that later on by letting someone go it sucks.

Firing people is the worst but if you\'re gonna start a company you have to be the kind of person that can do that when it needs to get done and as your company matures and you go through these different phases things are going to change.

Your role is going to drastically change over time.

In the beginning I describe myself as the janitor I was fixing things.

Things always need to be fixed.

I was always cleaning things up and fixing things documenting things things are going so fast that someone has to come back to fix things up every once in a while.

I was the janitor and this I think is why titles are bullshit.

Especially in the beginning of a company you just throw all your titles away.

Don\'t even worry about it don\'t bicker about who\'s going to be the CEO or the CTO or the CFO all that stuff is crap.

All this stuff is crap in the beginning.

There\'s way too much to be done to specialize that early on.

Things change a little bit when you get bigger you start to specialize a little bit more.

And then it\'s really important to think from the early days.

Do you have the right mix of personality types.

So for us I if I look at the different people who are in the company in the early days and why we\'ve been able to stay together as a team all four of us are still there today five years later I\'m sort of the logical pragmatic one of the group.

Chris is more of the product visionary one PJ is kind of a business operations minded person.

And Scott gards the culture and creates as much happiness as possible.

These are four sort of different vectors and in having a discussion in all are just all are decisions we would make by sitting down over beers and coming to a conclusion that was sort of in the middle.

We would all check and balance each other.

So think about when you\'re collecting the right people.

Do they have the right kind of mix to be effective in the long term because that\'s what you\'re going for.

 \[00:11:22\] So always think about how every person can effectively push the company forward if you can hire someone How are they going to push the company forward.

Because companies don\'t do things people do things and that\'s why people are all that matters.

And so I\'m going to have to audience help me for this real quick.

I want everyone from here over to on the count of 3 so 1 2 3 and then go read this off and say people are the only thing that matters.

You ready.

One two three people are the only thing that matters.

 \[00:11:59\] Thank you.

You\'re an excellent audience.

 \[00:12:03\] But wait customers don\'t interact with people not when you\'re building a product.

So how can they be the most important thing.

 \[00:12:17\] Product is actually the only thing that matters and things are getting interesting.

I think when you\'re thinking about your product you need to start with design.

It\'s how your customers interact with your products.

 \[00:12:34\] It\'s what they see it\'s what they feel.

Think of it like an automobile.

We all understand cars and trucks and things right.

This is your this is your experience this is what you\'re creating you\'re creating something that is like a vehicle.

Vehicles to us make a lot of sense.

They\'ve been refined year over year for a large part of last century.

So they become very good we all understand them.

This is what you\'re going for a product that feels so natural that it\'s like a car you can just get in.

You can drive it off the steering wheels here.

This pedal makes you go in this metal pedal makes you stop.

That\'s the product and what you exclude from your product is just as important as what you include in your product.

Take for instance Volkswagen the bug that had the little flower Vaisse right.

What the hell was that.

Now every time you get in your car it smells like dead organic matter and you wonder if Volkswagen the company is just the same thing is this dying company that\'s including these crazy things into their product.

What you what you leave out is just as important.

 \[00:13:45\] Everything that you add makes everything else less important.

 \[00:13:52\] So if you\'ve got your awesome car Ray in and you put that big spoiler on the back then you\'re neon ground effects aren\'t going to be as awesome because people are distracted by the spoiler.

So think about that everything that you add dilutes the entire product.

Art designer our first dedicated designer that we hired Kyle Knief has a very nice way of putting this he says focus over features and I think that\'s a very important thing to remember especially when you\'re early you can\'t do everything.

So the things that you do had better be awesome they better be the right things and don\'t deluded by just tacking on every possible thing that you can think of thinking that users want just as many features as possible.

People want great products not as many features as they want.

If you screw up your design then you screw up your product.

So make sure that one of your cofounders is design minded.

For us it was me.

If you\'re gonna do a startup and you\'re thinking about OK I\'m a technical guy and all all hire my technical friends and start a company together now you need a designer.

Go find a designer someone who is going to make your product something that customers want to use instead of stuff like the administrative screens of open source projects that we see today.

It\'s the big problem with open source is that there\'s not a lot of designers involved.

 \[00:15:19\] That\'s not what you want your company to be like.

 \[00:15:23\] Another thing is to think very much about your mission.

What is the mission of your company.

And I think that you should be able to say your mission in one sentence and in fact probably in less than 10 words.

So for us when get started our mission was very simple.

In fact it was on the Web site.

Some of you might remember it said get hosting no longer a pain in the ass because that was the core problem that we were trying to solve may get hosting really easy so you can share code with your friends.

It was a very simple mission.

Over time once we got further down the road of accomplishing that we started thinking more about developers as a whole.

What do they need to do to be effective at creating software.

It\'s more than just getting repositories online now it\'s about collaboration.

It\'s about them working together.

And so we changed our mission.

We stated it as make developers lives better everyday.

So we expanded the scope of what we were trying to solve.

Then we started building internal tools for ourselves.

Things that are beneficial to creating a software business.

And we started thinking about things a little bit differently still.

So we\'re going broader.

We started saying we use get help to build get Hobb because it\'s more products than just getWeb.com things like some things that you have seen like the jobs side jobs like it have dot com things like just a bigger suite of products that can help you solve more problems.

 \[00:16:58\] Now the final vision that we have now is what we call making it easier to work together than to work alone.

You\'ll see that it\'s completely divorced from software altogether.

And so I will actually answer your question what are we going to do with 100 million dollars.

It\'s that how many people in the world use code how many people in the world write code.

30 million maybe 40 if you\'re lucky.

How many people are there in the world.

There\'s a lot more room to fix collaboration than just software.

But this took a long time to get to.

We didn\'t start with this idea of fixing collaboration for the world.

We started with the idea of getting a repository from your computer onto the Internet.

That was it.

So remember that when you\'re solving a problem pick something that you can solve hopefully there\'s a direction that you can go that becomes bigger.

Right.

 \[00:17:58\] But choose something small in the beginning that you can actually solve if you bootstrap like we did and your product becomes popular.

Then you\'ll also be faced with a choice which is are we going to do this as a lifestyle business as our product going to be a lifestyle very niche kind of thing.

And yeah it\'ll make your lives really your lives really good you can live with that.

That way that\'s awesome.

Lots of people do this.

That\'s great.

But you also be faced with a choice which is do we want to blow this out.

 \[00:18:31\] We want to change the world.

If people like your product you\'ve got a bunch of users that\'s a choice that you\'ll have to make.

I like to think about it like the TV show Lost.

How many of you have seen that show.

Lots of you have seen that show yes.

I think the saddest thing in the world is a squandered opportunity.

And that\'s what lost was.

 \[00:19:03\] So that\'s the question when you\'re faced with that choice.

Think about what do you want to do with your life.

What are we trying to accomplish.

I think you\'re all here today to solve big problems.

So maybe you\'ve already made that choice but you might have to make it for real.

Down the road don\'t squander an opportunity.

Go for it.

Don\'t be like Lost.

For us it was the decision to reinvest everything that we made in the company into the company instead of banking it out putting in our own bank accounts.

It is also why we raised a hundred million dollars because GetUp is an opportunity.

We don\'t want to squander it.

 \[00:19:46\] Don\'t worry too much about when you enter a market.

Almost every product in the world is terrible.

Look at the list of products the things that use everyday.

Most of them are just downright crap.

If you know this and this is something that Apple knows very well with devices like the iPad right how many tablet computers were there before the iPad dozens all terrible.

Apple comes along and through making a good product they won.

That\'s what product means and that is why product is all that matters.

So you center section on a count of three.

Please help me in saying this phrase 1 to 3 product is all that matters.

 \[00:20:39\] But wait.

 \[00:20:43\] Products only come into being when people make decisions like we started with and the best decisions are made according to a consistent philosophy.

 \[00:20:54\] So philosophy is all that matters.

Philosophy derives from your people get again we never set out to create a specific culture.

 \[00:21:08\] The people that we hired created the culture at some point you might want to codify this culture that is inherently created through the people that you hire so that you can communicate it well.

Let me briefly explain what to me the five core values of get Alvar.

Number one optimizing for happiness.

If you want to learn more about that watch my talk from two years ago optimizing for happiness means think about what you\'re doing and how it\'s going to create more happiness in the world for your customers for your team members and for your shareholders.

If you do options like most startups do then your team members are also your shareholders.

If you raise money then your shareholders are part of that equation as well.

 \[00:22:00\] If you do those things if you optimize for happiness.

My theory is that profits will result naturally and it puts you on the right path to do things that matter.

Number two best argument wins.

 \[00:22:16\] This means that it\'s not about ego.

It\'s not about who you are where you came from.

It\'s about making good arguments.

Backing them up and being open to other people\'s arguments.

This is critical to avoiding politics within a company.

You can argue about something that matters and the argument is the thing and not the people behind it.

Then you can have good results.

You can create a good product and you can avoid politics.

Number three working from first principles.

Everything that we do we do from scratch.

You might think this is very inefficient.

Sometimes it is but we think through every problem that way because GitHub is a unique company just like every company is unique.

You can\'t just take the ideas that work for some other company and apply them to yourself and in fact you can\'t take the ideas that I give you today or anyone gives you today and just copy them and expect them to work for you.

 \[00:23:13\] You have to think about what it means for your company.

This is how you create something new something better.

Number four create superfans Traviss talk about Uber and how they delight their users on certain holidays giving them a motorcade.

That\'s the kind of stuff that I\'m talking about for us.

We do drink ups.

It\'s like a meetup except it\'s at a bar and we buy you beer for developers.

This turns out to be incredibly effective.

Laughter That\'s just one of many things how we deal with support.

What I love about our support team is that we measure our success the success of a support interaction by counting how many exclamation points are in the response from an end user.

That\'s creating superfans creating that kind of experience that goes above and beyond what is expected.

And number five be awesome and change the world.

That one\'s pretty self-explanatory.

So if you have a strong culture you can use it as a hiring tool.

It\'s amazingly effective and this is really critical today as it becomes more and more difficult to hire as all of you who would normally be entering the workforce are instead starting your own companies.

The pool of candidates is smaller.

The competition is higher since the early days of get how we\'ve evangelized our way of working our culture and our values and the philosophy that gives us that higher purpose.

All of this allows you to attract the kind of people that naturally fit your philosophy.

And so those people that you\'re attracting through this communication will make the right kinds of decisions and since decisions are how make people make products.

The philosophy that guides those decisions is all that matters.

So please third segment of the audience on 3 1 2 3.

Philosophy is all that matters.

 \[00:25:26\] I\'m not convinced that you believe it but okay so I\'ve told you three things that are the only things that matter.

 \[00:25:35\] How can that possibly be.

Which of these things three things is the only thing that matters.

I don\'t think I have to answer that question.

 \[00:25:44\] I think it\'s a false Tricon to me.

 \[00:25:50\] Someone really enjoyed that joke.

They do oh lord I\'m not done yet.

Hold on hold on hold hold on.

I\'m not going to end on false dichotomy.

Laughter.

In reality in reality just like the three quirks of it Adam cannot exist on their own people product and philosophy are also inseparable.

 \[00:26:21\] So do you guys remember what was the only thing that mattered people.

Do you guys remember the only thing that mattered.

Product.

Do you guys remember the only thing that mattered.

Philosophy on 3.

Everybody say what you said before together 1 to 3.

If you master these things then you will finally have the answer to the question how do I raise 100 million dollars thank you.
