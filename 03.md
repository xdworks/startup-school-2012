**Tom Preston Werner at Startup School 2012-mGTpU5XUAA8.mp4**  

\[00:00:00\] Hi everyone.

[00：00]大家好。

It\'s awesome to be back here with here in 2010.

2010年回到这里来真是太棒了。

Two years ago what\'s changed since then.

两年前，从那时起，情况发生了变化。

I\'m actually going to put this on the ground.

我要把这个放在地上。

This is my timer.

这是我的计时器。

You see part of being a founder of a company is solving your own problems.

作为一家公司的创始人，你可以看到，解决自己的问题是其中的一部分。

So I was thinking about this talk and what I would talk about what were the big questions would be for me about get hub where we\'ve been and where we go and what does it mean to to start a company today.

所以我在想这个演讲，我会说什么对我来说最重要的问题是什么，我们曾经去过的地方，去了哪里，今天开一家公司意味着什么。

And I figured most of you and especially after watching Ben\'s talk might be asking how do II as a budding entrepreneur raise 100 million dollars just like get up did.

我想，你们中的大多数人，尤其是在看完本的演讲后，可能会问，作为一名初出茅庐的企业家，我是如何筹集1亿美元的，就像“起床”一样。

Maybe that\'s the question that you\'re that you\'re wondering pretty much anywhere I go now.

也许这就是你想知道我现在去的任何地方的问题。

Everyone says hey Tom how\'s it going.

大家都说嗨，汤姆，你好吗？

What do you guys spend a million dollars on but this I think is the wrong question.

你们到底花了多少钱，但我认为这是个错误的问题。

I\'m actually going to tell you how to do that.

我要告诉你怎么做。

I\'m going to tell you something different.

我要告诉你一些不同的事情。

And I think that\'s because at the end of the day money isn\'t actually what matters.

我认为那是因为到头来钱并不重要。

Money is irrelevant.

钱是无关紧要的。

What is money.

什么是钱。

 \[00:01:17\] Money is just a number in some banks computer that says how many slides you can buy for your office.

[00：01：17]钱只是银行电脑里的一个数字，上面写着你能为你的办公室买多少张幻灯片。

Right but that\'s not what we care about.

对，但这不是我们所关心的。

That\'s not what we\'re trying to do here.

这不是我们想要做的。

We\'re not trying to just make more slides happen in the world.

我们并不是想让更多的幻灯片出现在这个世界上。

 \[00:01:34\] So what does matter.

[00：01：34]那么重要的是什么。

I think what matters is not the money.

我认为重要的不是钱。

Other things.

其他的东西。

So let\'s let\'s think about this.

所以让我们考虑一下这个。

 \[00:01:44\] I forgot my clicker.

[00：01：44]我忘了我的遥控器。

I need my clicker.

我需要我的遥控器。

This is going to be less impactful if I don\'t have my my thing.

如果我没有我的东西，这就不会那么有影响了。

OK.

好的

Thank you sir.

谢谢先生。

Hey you guys are in for a treat.

嘿你们要请客了。

Okay.

好的。

Now that I have this.

现在我有了这个。

OK.

好的

So let me let me let me make a posit and me posit something for you guys.

所以让我做个定金，我为你们准备一些东西。

A company is nothing except the decisions that it makes decisions are made by people.

一个公司除了做决定是由人做的以外，什么都不是。

And with me so far so the only thing that matters are people.

到目前为止，对我来说唯一重要的是人。

People are the only thing that matters and those people then had better be the right people.

人是唯一重要的东西，那些人最好是正确的人。

So let me tell you about get a job in the very early days get hub was started by myself and my co-founder Chris wants to off.

所以，让我告诉你，在很早的时候找到一份工作，GET中心是由我自己创建的，我的联合创始人克里斯想离开。

Initially there was two of us.

一开始是我们两个人。

What I did was the design the front end the very that just the visual and the axe.

我所做的是设计，前端，就是视觉和斧头。

I also did the very back end which is how rails code Access\'s get repositories on disk so I\'m kind of this weird creature and then I do the front end stuff and I do the back end stuff but I\'ve been doing rails for a long time before that and I didn\'t really like it really like rails.

我也做了非常后端的工作，这就是Rails代码访问在磁盘上获取存储库的方式，所以我是个奇怪的家伙，然后我做前端的东西，做后端的东西，但是在那之前我已经做了很长时间的Rails，我不太喜欢Rails。

You can tell the world and I actually like rails out much.

你可以告诉世界，我非常喜欢铁轨。

And so I was through you know being in the Ruby community and going to Ruby meet ups this is how I found my co-founder and Chris Strath was very big into rails he had a blog post that outlined everything about how to be the best Rails developer you can be.

所以，我通过你知道，在Ruby社区，去Ruby见Ups，这就是我发现我的联合创始人克里斯·斯特拉斯(ChrisStrath)非常喜欢Rails，他有一篇博客文章概述了如何成为最好的Rails开发人员。

Everything about it was amazing.

一切都很棒。

I said this is a guy that I can start a company with because we have complementary skills.

我说这是一个我可以和他一起创办公司的人，因为我们有互补的技能。

I\'ll do the front and back and he\'ll do the middle part and together we have the whole thing.

我做前面和后面的，他做中间的部分，我们一起做整个事情。

And that worked out really well we just started hacking on it on the side side project.

结果很好，我们刚刚开始在附带项目上进行黑客攻击。

But then shortly thereafter.

但不久之后。

And here\'s here\'s a little tidbit about how can you tell whether your startup idea is actually gaining traction.

这是一个关于你如何判断你的创业想法是否真的在吸引人的小窍门。

How is it how do you how can you tell people enjoy it.

你怎么能告诉人们喜欢它。

One thing that was really effective for us was when people came to us in the private beta phase and they asked Can I pay for this.

对我们来说真正有效的一件事是，当人们来到我们的私人测试版时，他们问我能支付这个费用吗？

We had no billing system and yet they wanted to pay for it.

我们没有计费系统，但他们却想为此付出代价。

They wanted to make sure that it would continue to exist so that it would continue to solve their problems.

他们希望确保它继续存在，以便它能够继续解决他们的问题。

So if you have customers asking you to pay for your company\'s product before you can even sell it to them that\'s a good sign.

因此，如果你的客户要求你在销售公司产品之前支付公司产品的费用，那将是一个好兆头。

So in order to accomplish this in order to get this company to a place where people could actually buy it.

为了实现这一目标，为了让这家公司能够让人们真正买到它。

We hired our third co-founder.

我们雇了第三位联合创始人。

He came on board was just a few months after we had started and he has his first thing built the billing system.

他是在我们开始工作几个月后才上船的，他的第一件事就是建立计费系统。

PJ Hiatt so now we had two rails guys essentially and misto doing front and back and we\'re building out a better mix of people and skills to accomplish what we need to do to get done.

PJHiatt，所以现在我们有两个Rails的家伙，基本上和错误的做前面和后面，我们正在建立一个更好的人员和技能的组合，以完成我们需要做的事情。

Our first employee that we hired named Scott cone he is a get expert.

我们雇佣的第一位员工叫斯科特·科内，他是一位GET专家。

So we reached a level in the company where we kind of maxed out our knowledge none of us were really get experts and yet we\'re building the site get Hubb which is for hosting get repositories.

因此，我们在公司达到了一个水平，在那里，我们的知识达到了极限，我们中没有人是真正的专家，但我们正在建设一个网站，GET Hubb，它是用来托管GET存储库的。

So again through meet ups we met Scott we talked to him we talked him about product about how he would go about building things and he was the one that built just which is the snippet sharing site.

所以，通过见面，我们遇到了斯科特，我们和他谈了谈产品，我们谈到了他如何去建造东西，而他就是那个建立了一个片段共享网站的人。

He built from scratch as his first task bringing his knowledge into the equation.

他白手起家，把他的知识纳入方程式，这是他的第一项任务。

And so you can see are assembling a broader diversity of people who can accomplish more things.

所以你可以看到，他们聚集了更多的人，他们可以完成更多的事情。

We max out our Get knowledge.

我们最大限度地利用我们的知识。

Let\'s bring someone in that can augment that.

让我们找个能增加这一点的人来。

And you\'ll notice that none of these people none of the four of us were businesspeople.

你会注意到，这些人中没有一个是商人，我们四个人都不是商人。

None of us had ever really gone into business all that much.

我们谁也没有做过这么多的生意。

I\'d done some consulting but that doesn\'t really count.

我做过一些咨询，但这并不算什么。

None of us had created large businesses.

我们中没有人创造过大企业。

None of us had an MBA background or a business background like that.

我们都没有工商管理硕士学位，也没有这样的商业背景。

So none of us either were executives.

所以我们都不是高管。

None of us had this really broad experience in creating a company that you might as as a person starting out think well how are we going to solve this problem.

我们中没有一个人在创建一家公司方面有过如此广泛的经验，作为一个刚开始创业的人，我们应该如何解决这个问题。

Well let\'s let\'s hire an executive because they know what they\'re doing.

那么，让我们雇用一名高管，因为他们知道自己在做什么。

Now you have two problems.

现在你有两个问题。

Here\'s the thing.

事情是这样的。

There are executives and they\'re awesome great people but they know so much they know so much that it can be detrimental I think to a startup where you\'re really trying to solve a new problem in a different way.

这里有一些高管，他们都是了不起的伟人，但他们知道的太多了，我认为这对一家创业公司来说是有害的，因为你真的在用另一种方式解决一个新的问题。

You have to come to problems with beginner\'s mind not knowing something can be a very powerful tool into accomplishing it because you don\'t know that it\'s not possible.

你必须解决初学者头脑不知道的问题，因为你不知道这是不可能的，所以这是一个非常强大的工具。

That\'s what doing a startup is not realizing that something is impossible and doing it anyway.

这就是为什么创业并不会意识到某些事情是不可能的，而且无论如何都会去做。

Something else that was a commonality between us the people in get hub in the earliest days was having worked for bad companies before having worked in places where they did things wrong examples of how not to do something are just as good as examples of how to do something.

我们之间的共同之处-最初在GET中心工作的人-在他们做错事的地方之前曾为坏公司工作过，如何不做某事的例子和如何做某事的例子一样好。

And I think this is what companies are for.

我认为这就是公司的职责所在。

Companies solve problems.

公司解决问题。

Great companies solve real problems and if you haven\'t ever experienced problems then how can you know what are the right ones to solve.

伟大的公司解决真正的问题，如果你从来没有经历过问题，那么你怎么知道什么是正确的解决方法。

So you\'re all here to do startups to join startups to create startups.

所以，你们都是来做初创公司的，加入创业公司来创建创业公司。

I think that if your options are create a startup or try and you know go work for another company going on working for other companies is not so bad because it gives you this really excellent perspective on things to not do actually.

我认为，如果你的选择是创建一家初创公司或尝试，而你知道，去为另一家公司工作，继续为其他公司工作并不是那么糟糕，因为它给了你一个非常好的视角，你可以不去做一些事情。

So getting experience elsewhere.

所以在其他地方积累经验。

Not so bad right.

没那么糟吧。

A lot of great people start startups had a bunch of full time jobs before that.

在此之前，许多优秀的创业公司都有大量的全职工作。

I had five.

我有五个。

I had five full time jobs before starting get a job.

在开始找工作之前我做了五份全职工作。

So suffering can sometimes lead to a better product for having that information.

因此，痛苦有时会为获得这些信息带来更好的结果。

Something that\'s great with people is getting together we would meet for beers all the time and we\'d talk over the problems that we had.

有件很棒的事情就是和人们聚在一起，我们总是在一起喝啤酒，我们会讨论我们遇到的问题。

We\'d go to a bar called O\'Reilly\'s up in North Beach San Francisco and we\'d just talk through the big problems right.

我们会去一家名为O‘Reilly的酒吧，在旧金山的北海滩，我们只会讨论那些大问题。

People are very important having the same ideas for the product direction is important.

人是非常重要的，对产品的方向有相同的想法是很重要的。

Getting on the same page for that stuff is going to allow you to push forward.

做同样的事情会让你向前推进。

If you find yourself in a situation where you\'re not getting along with your cofounders or the very small team that you\'ve created to begin with really step back and evaluate that problem because I don\'t think you can push forward effectively if you\'re fighting each other.

如果你发现自己与你的共同创始人或你创建的非常小的团队相处不融洽，那么你首先要退一步，评估这个问题，因为我不认为如果你们互相争斗，你们就不能有效地向前推进。

Look at that.

看那儿

You should be getting along if you\'re not really really think about what that means.

如果你没有真正想清楚那意味着什么，你就应该和睦相处。

Hiring is hard.

招聘是很难的。

Hiring the right people is incredibly hard.

雇佣合适的人是非常困难的。

Sometimes you\'ll screw it up.

有时候你会搞砸的。

We hired a sales person in the very early days and we had to let him go because he wasn\'t the culture fit it was because we hadn\'t had experience with that kind of hiring before.

我们很早就雇了一名销售人员，我们不得不让他走，因为他的文化不适合，这是因为我们以前没有这样的招聘经验。

And that\'s OK.

那也没关系。

You\'re going to screw up hiring.

你会搞砸招聘的。

You have to be in a place mentally where you can fix that later on by letting someone go it sucks.

你必须呆在一个精神上的地方，在那里你以后可以通过放某人走来解决这个问题-这太糟糕了。

Firing people is the worst but if you\'re gonna start a company you have to be the kind of person that can do that when it needs to get done and as your company matures and you go through these different phases things are going to change.

解雇员工是最糟糕的，但如果你想创办一家公司，你必须是那种在公司需要完成时才能做到这一点的人，随着公司的成熟，你经历了这些不同的阶段，事情就会发生变化。

Your role is going to drastically change over time.

随着时间的推移，你的角色将会发生巨大的变化。

In the beginning I describe myself as the janitor I was fixing things.

一开始，我把自己描述成看门人，我在修东西。

Things always need to be fixed.

事情总是需要解决的。

I was always cleaning things up and fixing things documenting things things are going so fast that someone has to come back to fix things up every once in a while.

我总是清理东西，修理东西，记录事情进展得如此之快，以至于每隔一段时间就得有人回来修理东西。

I was the janitor and this I think is why titles are bullshit.

我是看门人，我想这就是为什么头衔是胡说八道的原因。

Especially in the beginning of a company you just throw all your titles away.

尤其是在一家公司刚成立的时候，你就把你所有的头衔都扔掉了。

Don\'t even worry about it don\'t bicker about who\'s going to be the CEO or the CTO or the CFO all that stuff is crap.

甚至不用担心这件事，不要为谁会成为首席执行官、首席技术官或首席财务官而争吵-所有这些都是一派胡言。

All this stuff is crap in the beginning.

一开始这些东西都是垃圾。

There\'s way too much to be done to specialize that early on.

要尽早把它专门化，还有很多事情要做。

Things change a little bit when you get bigger you start to specialize a little bit more.

事情发生了一些变化，当你变得更大的时候，你就开始变得更专业了。

And then it\'s really important to think from the early days.

从早期开始思考就很重要了。

Do you have the right mix of personality types.

你有合适的性格组合吗。

So for us I if I look at the different people who are in the company in the early days and why we\'ve been able to stay together as a team all four of us are still there today five years later I\'m sort of the logical pragmatic one of the group.

所以对我们来说，如果我看看早期在公司工作的不同的人，以及为什么我们能够作为一个团队呆在一起-五年后我们四个人都还在一起-我就算是一个合乎逻辑的、务实的团队了。

Chris is more of the product visionary one PJ is kind of a business operations minded person.

克里斯是更有远见的产品，一位PJ是一位有商业经营头脑的人。

And Scott gards the culture and creates as much happiness as possible.

斯科特对文化进行了掩饰，创造了尽可能多的幸福。

These are four sort of different vectors and in having a discussion in all are just all are decisions we would make by sitting down over beers and coming to a conclusion that was sort of in the middle.

这些是四种不同的向量，在讨论中，我们都是通过坐下来喝啤酒，得出一个中间的结论来做决定的。

We would all check and balance each other.

我们都会互相制衡。

So think about when you\'re collecting the right people.

所以想想当你收集合适的人的时候。

Do they have the right kind of mix to be effective in the long term because that\'s what you\'re going for.

从长远来看，他们是否有合适的组合才能有效，因为这正是你所要追求的。

 \[00:11:22\] So always think about how every person can effectively push the company forward if you can hire someone How are they going to push the company forward.

[00：11：22]所以，一定要想一想，如果你能雇用一个人，每个人都能有效地推动公司前进，他们将如何推动公司前进呢？

Because companies don\'t do things people do things and that\'s why people are all that matters.

因为公司不做别人做的事情，这就是为什么人才是最重要的。

And so I\'m going to have to audience help me for this real quick.

所以我得让观众帮我个忙。

I want everyone from here over to on the count of 3 so 1 2 3 and then go read this off and say people are the only thing that matters.

我希望从这里的每个人数到3，所以，1，2，3，然后去读这篇文章，说人是唯一重要的事情。

You ready.

准备好了。

One two three people are the only thing that matters.

一、二、三人是唯一重要的事。

 \[00:11:59\] Thank you.

[00：11：59]谢谢。

You\'re an excellent audience.

你是个很棒的观众。

 \[00:12:03\] But wait customers don\'t interact with people not when you\'re building a product.

[00：12：03]但是等待的顾客不会与人互动，而不是在你生产产品的时候。

So how can they be the most important thing.

所以他们怎么可能是最重要的。

 \[00:12:17\] Product is actually the only thing that matters and things are getting interesting.

[00：12：17]产品实际上是唯一重要的东西，而且事情正在变得有趣。

I think when you\'re thinking about your product you need to start with design.

我认为当你想到你的产品时，你需要从设计开始。

It\'s how your customers interact with your products.

这是你的客户如何与你的产品互动。

 \[00:12:34\] It\'s what they see it\'s what they feel.

[00：12：34]这是他们所看到的，是他们的感受。

Think of it like an automobile.

把它想象成一辆汽车。

We all understand cars and trucks and things right.

我们都明白汽车、卡车和其他东西是正确的。

This is your this is your experience this is what you\'re creating you\'re creating something that is like a vehicle.

这是你的，这是你的经验，这是你所创造的东西，就像一辆车。

Vehicles to us make a lot of sense.

车辆对我们来说很有意义。

They\'ve been refined year over year for a large part of last century.

它们在上个世纪的大部分时间里都是一年比一年改进的。

So they become very good we all understand them.

所以他们变得很好我们都理解他们。

This is what you\'re going for a product that feels so natural that it\'s like a car you can just get in.

这就是你想要的产品，它感觉非常自然，就像一辆你可以直接上车的汽车。

You can drive it off the steering wheels here.

你可以把它从方向盘上开下来。

This pedal makes you go in this metal pedal makes you stop.

这个踏板让你进入这个金属踏板让你停下来。

That\'s the product and what you exclude from your product is just as important as what you include in your product.

这就是你的产品，你从你的产品中排除出来的东西和你在产品中包含的内容一样重要。

Take for instance Volkswagen the bug that had the little flower Vaisse right.

举个例子，大众的小花Vaisse的小虫子是对的。

What the hell was that.

那是什么鬼东西。

Now every time you get in your car it smells like dead organic matter and you wonder if Volkswagen the company is just the same thing is this dying company that\'s including these crazy things into their product.

现在，每次你上车的时候，闻起来都像死了的有机物，你在想，大众汽车公司是不是也是一样的东西呢？这个垂死的公司把这些疯狂的东西都包括进了他们的产品里。

What you what you leave out is just as important.

你遗漏的东西同样重要。

 \[00:13:45\] Everything that you add makes everything else less important.

[00：13：45]你添加的每一件事都会使其他的事情变得不那么重要。

 \[00:13:52\] So if you\'ve got your awesome car Ray in and you put that big spoiler on the back then you\'re neon ground effects aren\'t going to be as awesome because people are distracted by the spoiler.

[00：13：52]如果你的车很棒，雷，你在后面放了一个大的扰流板，那么你的霓虹灯地面效果就不会那么棒了，因为人们会被扰流板分散注意力。

So think about that everything that you add dilutes the entire product.

所以想一想，你添加的所有东西都会稀释整个产品。

Art designer our first dedicated designer that we hired Kyle Knief has a very nice way of putting this he says focus over features and I think that\'s a very important thing to remember especially when you\'re early you can\'t do everything.

我们聘请的第一位致力于艺术设计的设计师凯尔·克尼夫(Kyle Knief)用一种很好的方式表达了这一点，他说，专注于功能，我认为这是一件非常重要的事情，尤其是在你还早的时候，你不能什么都做。

So the things that you do had better be awesome they better be the right things and don\'t deluded by just tacking on every possible thing that you can think of thinking that users want just as many features as possible.

所以，你所做的事情最好是很棒的，它们最好是正确的东西，不要被你认为用户想要尽可能多的功能的每一件可能的事情所迷惑。

People want great products not as many features as they want.

人们需要伟大的产品，而不像他们想要的那样多。

If you screw up your design then you screw up your product.

如果你搞砸了你的设计，那么你就把你的产品搞砸了。

So make sure that one of your cofounders is design minded.

所以，确保你的联合创始人之一是有设计意识的。

For us it was me.

对我们来说是我。

If you\'re gonna do a startup and you\'re thinking about OK I\'m a technical guy and all all hire my technical friends and start a company together now you need a designer.

如果你要做一家初创公司，而你又在考虑好的话，我是个技术人员，所有的人都会雇佣我的技术朋友，一起创办一家公司，现在你需要一个设计师。

Go find a designer someone who is going to make your product something that customers want to use instead of stuff like the administrative screens of open source projects that we see today.

去找一个设计师，他会让你的产品成为客户想要使用的东西，而不是像我们今天看到的开源项目的管理屏幕这样的东西。

It\'s the big problem with open source is that there\'s not a lot of designers involved.

开源的最大问题在于没有太多的设计师参与进来。

 \[00:15:19\] That\'s not what you want your company to be like.

[00：15：19]那不是你想让你的公司成为什么样的人。

 \[00:15:23\] Another thing is to think very much about your mission.

[00：15：23]另一件事是好好想想你的使命。

What is the mission of your company.

你们公司的任务是什么。

And I think that you should be able to say your mission in one sentence and in fact probably in less than 10 words.

我认为你应该能够用一句话来表达你的使命，事实上，你应该用不到10个字来表达你的使命。

So for us when get started our mission was very simple.

所以对我们来说，当我们开始的时候，我们的任务非常简单。

In fact it was on the Web site.

事实上它在网站上。

Some of you might remember it said get hosting no longer a pain in the ass because that was the core problem that we were trying to solve may get hosting really easy so you can share code with your friends.

你们中的一些人可能还记得它说，获得托管不再是一个痛苦的屁股，因为这是我们试图解决的核心问题，可能会使托管变得非常容易，这样您就可以与您的朋友共享代码。

It was a very simple mission.

这是一个非常简单的任务。

Over time once we got further down the road of accomplishing that we started thinking more about developers as a whole.

随着时间的推移，我们在完成这一目标的道路上走得更远，我们开始更多地考虑开发人员作为一个整体。

What do they need to do to be effective at creating software.

他们需要做些什么才能有效地创建软件。

It\'s more than just getting repositories online now it\'s about collaboration.

它不仅仅是让存储库在线，现在它是关于协作的。

It\'s about them working together.

是关于他们一起工作的。

And so we changed our mission.

所以我们改变了任务。

We stated it as make developers lives better everyday.

我们说这是为了让开发者每天都过得更好。

So we expanded the scope of what we were trying to solve.

所以我们扩大了我们想要解决的问题的范围。

Then we started building internal tools for ourselves.

然后我们开始为自己建立内部工具。

Things that are beneficial to creating a software business.

有利于创建软件业务的事情。

And we started thinking about things a little bit differently still.

我们开始考虑一些不同的事情。

So we\'re going broader.

所以我们要走得更远。

We started saying we use get help to build get Hobb because it\'s more products than just getWeb.com things like some things that you have seen like the jobs side jobs like it have dot com things like just a bigger suite of products that can help you solve more problems.

我们开始说我们用GET帮助来构建GET HOBB，因为它比仅仅获得Web.com的产品更多，有些东西你已经看到了，比如工作方面的工作，比如它有点COM，就像一个更大的产品套件，可以帮助你解决更多的问题。

 \[00:16:58\] Now the final vision that we have now is what we call making it easier to work together than to work alone.

[00：16：58]现在，我们现在的最终愿景是，我们所称的使我们更容易一起工作，而不是独自工作。

You\'ll see that it\'s completely divorced from software altogether.

你会发现它完全脱离了软件。

And so I will actually answer your question what are we going to do with 100 million dollars.

所以我会回答你的问题，我们要用1亿美元做什么？

It\'s that how many people in the world use code how many people in the world write code.

世界上有多少人使用代码，世界上有多少人编写代码。

30 million maybe 40 if you\'re lucky.

如果你幸运的话，三千万也许四千万。

How many people are there in the world.

世界上有多少人。

There\'s a lot more room to fix collaboration than just software.

除了软件之外，还有更多的空间来解决协作问题。

But this took a long time to get to.

但这需要很长时间才能完成。

We didn\'t start with this idea of fixing collaboration for the world.

我们不是从这个想法开始的，那就是为世界解决合作问题。

We started with the idea of getting a repository from your computer onto the Internet.

我们一开始的想法是从你的电脑上获得一个储存库到互联网上。

That was it.

就这样了。

So remember that when you\'re solving a problem pick something that you can solve hopefully there\'s a direction that you can go that becomes bigger.

所以请记住，当你解决一个问题的时候，选择一些你能解决的事情，希望有一个方向，你可以去，它会变得更大。

Right.

右（边），正确的

 \[00:17:58\] But choose something small in the beginning that you can actually solve if you bootstrap like we did and your product becomes popular.

[00：17：58]但是，在开始的时候，选择一些小的东西，如果你像我们一样引导你，并且你的产品变得流行的话，你实际上可以解决这个问题。

Then you\'ll also be faced with a choice which is are we going to do this as a lifestyle business as our product going to be a lifestyle very niche kind of thing.

然后你也会面临一个选择，那就是，我们是否会把这作为一种生活方式来做，因为我们的产品将成为一种非常利基的生活方式。

And yeah it\'ll make your lives really your lives really good you can live with that.

是的，这会让你的生活变得很好，你可以忍受这样的生活。

That way that\'s awesome.

那样的话那就太棒了。

Lots of people do this.

很多人都这么做。

That\'s great.

太棒了。

But you also be faced with a choice which is do we want to blow this out.

但你也面临着一个选择，那就是我们是否想把这一切搞砸。

 \[00:18:31\] We want to change the world.

[00：18：31]我们想改变世界。

If people like your product you\'ve got a bunch of users that\'s a choice that you\'ll have to make.

如果人们喜欢你的产品，你就会有一群用户，这是你必须做出的选择。

I like to think about it like the TV show Lost.

我喜欢把它想象成电视节目“迷失”。

How many of you have seen that show.

你们当中有多少人看过那个节目。

Lots of you have seen that show yes.

你们很多人都看过那个节目是的。

I think the saddest thing in the world is a squandered opportunity.

我认为世界上最可悲的事情是浪费机会。

And that\'s what lost was.

这就是迷失的原因。

 \[00:19:03\] So that\'s the question when you\'re faced with that choice.

[00：19：03]当你面临这样的选择时，这就是问题所在。

Think about what do you want to do with your life.

想想你想用你的生活做什么。

What are we trying to accomplish.
