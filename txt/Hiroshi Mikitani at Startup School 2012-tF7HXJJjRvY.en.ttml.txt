- thank you for coming thank you very much for inviting so many people there's a lot of people so maybe to start you could just tell us a little bit about what Rakatan is and how you got started okay so I found it in Iraq then in 1997 as a matter of fact you know I was trying to partner with one of you found a program and you know my concept was to recreate what we call internet shopping mall or in Japan and it was very very and the early days and we try to do is fall for viruses it didn't go through so we started to hire you know young graduate school students started from initial capital of 200,000 USD never raised any money from any VC just hired young guys and went public in 2000 and started to you know buy many companies now we are number one in ecommerce about 35 to 40 percent market share in terms of e-commerce number one on my travel number one in only banking number two in only brokerage and we do about 38 different businesses in Japan and we sell to globalize our business so now we are in more than 13 countries we bought the second largest even a company called Kobo which is extremely well in Europe in Canada in in Asia so we are a little bit different Internet company in Japan and now trying to globalize our business how it's starting the company in Japan and growing a company in Japan different than Silicon Valley well you know there is no really you know venture capital ecosystem no no there are venture capitals but but not like you know i you know ii body-type sort of food service pcs they will invest but not much they will not get involved into the management that much so just kind of providing the capital so how did you learn the lessons that VC's in Silicon Valley tradition traditionally help entrepreneurs well how did you learn how to run a company and grow it I don't know how she invited me she's are helping VC venture companies because I have never experienced but the way again I found it acting with my own you know the money initial capital was just two hundred thousand USD but since I knew that I am NOT going to be funded a huge amount from VC I created sort of cash flow system so that I don't need to rely on NBC we asked our merchants to pay five hundred dollars per month but we asked them to pay us six months up front so from the second months of our service my company was cashflow positive you can cash faster every month since yes very impressive is there any looking back to that first year you know when you were sort of becoming cashflow positive very quickly and figuring this out as you went are there any things that stick out that you would do differently well so again we never raised any money from outside we raised later on from friends and families we didn't need any money but this was kind of just a you know for the friendship for sake which I want to make my family and my friends happy but how far along were you when you did that friends and family around no that was like six months before we go public yeah two days before we our IPO my friend masses on Softbank call me and ask me to let him in but I said it's too late but well we were very patient to be honest we were very patient for the first three years and try to be create the you know kernel of our business model so we're not trying to copy the with the model amazon.com or eBay we're trying to create a great system to support medium to small size merchants to sell their product all over Japan so we we try to create an extremely strong culture of the company because I knew that I'm going to be in this business for a long long time so we didn't rush we were very patient did you figure out that kernel on the first try that you get right the thing that made rocket and what it is the first strategy of to iterate and evolve to get well one thing we did differently from most of us base ecommerce company is we try to facilitate the communication between the merchants and consumers because the way I feel is of course in buying products price is important the efficiency is important but more than that in my opinion the buy thing you know should be fun and we need to create a very rich experience so we try to be a liason between the consumer and the retailer instead of you know trying to compete against the retailer using the ID we want to use our technology to help small to medium-sized enterprise do business with consumers so that was totally different idea and I was 100% confident my employees will really like the idea of helping small to medium sized companies rather than trying to destroy their business so I mean as you said this is very different than anyone else was doing any commerce at the time really still is did you know that that that was going to be the model you're going to after before you started the company was that were you convinced that this was what you were going to do differently we didn't think about how we're gonna do it differently but we know what we wanted to do I always don't think about our competitor that much because you know you cannot do too many things about that right you just need to focus on what you do to improve your you know service and improve customer satisfaction I think that's part of nature of Japanese companies keep improving improving improving how did you grow and it both in the early days when you were signing up these small and medium businesses that you wanted to help and then in the later days obviously you made a lot of acquisitions to help drive growth could you just talk about how you figured out growth all along the way well of course we have a organic growth and we buy many companies and domestically and internationally domestically we created three things one great brand by the way we have a professional baseball covering egos and so everybody knows rockland brand even if you don't use Internet they know rafting brand we host a TV 500 tennis tournament so we have extremely strong band too we created the strongest mileage reward program conducting super points so we can use those points to cross-sell our service and we also created the sort of the consumer database to analyze consumer data and now about 880 million so about 90 percent of internet populations are our member and we can use our currency our points to cross-sell virus service to them back to the topic of acquisitions what do you look for when you make an acquisition and and how do you integrate the the company into rocket 10 so that you're all one company together also there's two types of Ephesians we make one is period geographic expansion to buy a time so we bought a five calm in the US play calm you can press Minister in France and really try to use their presence and brand name and the their presence and and convert their business model to lock the model the second type is addition to our ecosystem a very chain like cobol which is not doing as well as in other countries but they are very strong they have more market share and in Canada and in France and the in Japan so we need we knew that we need a digital book service in our sort of a product lineup so and we know that we can use our membership to facilitate the growth of cocoa business so so there is two types geographic expansion to buy a time and also addition to our ecosystem and then once you make these acquisitions how do you integrate them into the culture of Rakatan mission practice and value so before buying a company we talk about our dream and goal and our culture and talk over and over and over again before we make our questions if they don't like our culture or our practice or mission we are not we're going to buy even if you like that service because it's it doesn't make sense to lose the you know founders and and management of your company so we we talked over before the closure of the deal we talked a lot about those kind of things and what's your success rate for acquisitions in terms of good integration on those points Oh difficult question I don't know but they're still on their work one you know only one failure we made was we went into China partnering with Baidu which is largest search engine company in China but it didn't work out well so we all we discussed with them and agree that we should shut the business down and we withdrew from China yet year ago so that's is the only you know the big failure I recognize at this moment even more than the sort of the tree culture I'll use you've talked about you know one thing that I just heard again and again is that Rakatan is known for having having a great culture could you talk about how you've held that culture all the way through for the last 15 years as you said how do you think about the culture the company needs to be to be success to have to be successful so in my opinion you need have two things one is of course innovation and the second part is operation and the innovation is kind of not so difficult to encourage people to be innovative but at the same time if you want to scale your business you need to have a strong operation culture as well and you wanted to achieve strong operation culture you need to have sort of you know the shared practices and the you know it's kind of a the framework for managing the company probably mainly using more numbers and KPIs but most likely the entrepreneurs don't like you know just running in the numbers but I think you know being you know quantitative analytical qualitative is also very important so recently you invested in Pinterest could you talk a little bit about how that came together and and what you see in Pinterest and how you hope the relationship is going to evolve well I think Pinterest of course been spoke I just had a phone call with him and I think he was great he's great we like the company and I think Pinterest is very different from other social networks it's very you know graphical and appeals to the heart of your interest and it has a strong influence over to buying behavior and buying decisions of the people so as an e-commerce company I think the Pinterest is the best social network so we found Pinterest and I had a meeting with Ben had a drink and Cara okay and and he liked me he led us in whatever I think maybe has been but he he saw I think he had seen something different in us you know compared with other US based internet companies or VCS I will ask him what do you see is the big challenges and the opportunities in retail and e-commerce coming down over the next few years of course you know I think this is the stage stage one for e-commerce now we are seeing a lot of these content sales so the books CDs DVDs games everything will be digital and online definitely the logistics will become more and more important and there are lots of innovative logistics companies using you know robots and automation to you know we improve the efficiency and also the devices the mobile phones smartphones the tablet will become the major device to divide products and maybe there will be a certain social I think the social shopping is still nobody we find the strong answer to it but I think individually will come for for social shopping or anything else are the other major ways you identified the Japanese consumers behave differently than consumers anywhere else in the world well Lockton is what I call very shop centric marketplace meaning that there every shop have a very different you know characters and also the design and the user experience and we provided all sorts of tools for them to make fans around shop so I think wrapping was very social from the day one we try to create a fans around shops not around Rockland OCAP but the fans around shops and all these shops has what you know professional staff and they are the sort of curator of the wines or sports in goods or you know groceries and so forth so I think my question is so if you want to buy some product do you want to ask your friend or do you want to ask the staff at Pro Shop and my of course sometimes your friend is can give you better advice than this staff at the Pro Shop but most time you know I think you know we usually ask professionals so that was our approach and I think it worked extremely well in Japan and now we're testing in other countries and I think it's it's working very well as well and can you talk you talked a little bit about mobile and tablets but obviously in Japan that's become a huge way that people are not in you know probably even bigger than here where it seems like our own right on the phone all the time how much are you thinking about mobile and how are you thinking about mobile is sort of the future of the company well already 25% of rocked and transaction which is big we do about 15 billion USD or even more this year just for pure e-commerce in Japan and already 25 percent of transaction is coming from mobile devices including feature phone smart phone maybe a 60% for smartphone and 40% a future phone and smartphone transaction is growing about 300 to 400 percent year-on-year so it will be more than 50 percent within a couple of years it's huge we that is HUGE you said something earlier that was so interesting to me I made a note to go back to it which is that you did you don't think a lot about competition because you can't do much about that one thing that I start ups all the time is fear about competition so when you were starting the company and Amazon and eBay were were huge was that a problem for you do people ask you what are you gonna do about on ebay you know how are you gonna beat them how you can compete with them and how did you think about sort of how did you stay focused on doing your own thing and ignoring competition well let me put it I learn from competitors but I'm not afraid of competitors because even if you're afraid of it doesn't be any good for you so I learned what they're doing and then maybe you know try to match if I have to but I think the the way we approach if commerce is totally different from amazon.com because again we are trying to facilitate the transaction with medium to small merchants to the larger ones to the consumers as a consequence you know we have big brands almost all department stores big a big fashion brands almost entire a photonic companies are using a platform but that and that's major portion of our business but approaches to how to help small to medium-sized merchants to do business with the consumers so but let's see I think we have a philosophical difference between ourselves and amazon.com so I'm not very afraid of them but we I'm always thinking about how we can scale our business how would you know a time by the way five let's see what's most interesting here we were talking a little bit backstage about just sort of Japanese culture and the differences between starting a startup here and we talked about investing could you talk about hiring and how you hired the initial people and especially in a culture where joining a start-up is not as cool as it was maybe now as it is in the valley well now of course it's different from fifteen years ago when I started a company you know nobody wanted work for small startups but now they have seen many successes and there are so many young people who wanna work for the you know startups and ventures and so forth I think the way I am in hiring in younger people and not not to hire the meet - you know upper aged people as much as possible because I knew that we want to impress our original corporate culture so that wasn't very important for me to hire younger people and educate them especially nowadays after we went public we started to hire many more we got great great hair people and you know we because we need that we have more professional expertise and two and a half years ago we announced that we are going to convert internal communication language from Japanese to English and this was a big splash in the Japanese society and some CEOs you know you know explicitly announce that we are crazy company as well as we are but now 70% of new engineers joining Sarno in Japanese 30% of new employees are non Japanese so we had to decolonize in our you know recruitment mark zuckerberg a few years ago made a comment about hiring young people preferentially and it was the all that the press talked about for two weeks so maybe you'll be featured a lot now I'm talking on that why did you make that decision to make English the official language of the company well so the thing I have done in Japan is we try to create an open culture company so we discuss almost all information to entire employees so the people who is doing e-commerce know what's going on for our banking business and we cost share all these expertise and plat forces as possible you know web marketing you know engineering and so forth and so forth so that was our strength how common is that for Japanese companies to do to share everything openly well sharing the code opening up is very common and we call this Yoko 10 meaning a horizontal particle you know transfer of expertise I think that is one of the strengths of Japanese company because you know it's not good or bad it's not so performance oriented devious system and I wanted to do this globally but I couldn't because most of the expertise is in Japan and our most of our stuff cannot communicate in English so you know I was kind of liason between our global business and Japanese business and I was getting really tired just you know talking you know and being translating everything and so one day I woke up and you know thought about everything in English and so I stood in front of entire services employees and told them I am going to convert the offshore business language of rockton from Japanese to English almost the reaction in that room was very quiet very quiet but has totally changed the TOEIC score of our employees improve almost 200 points for the last two years what score sir I said I got English test you know and most of the staff can manage to communicate in English they are not afraid of you know going abroad or joining to the international conference now we have so many people you know in Japanese foreigners in their Tokyo office and now they started to benchmark international failures instead of domestic players so I thought I changed that's great one last question we were talking backstage and the last time that Paul and Miki met was 16 or 17 years ago when Paul was working on dia web so Paul loves to ask people at these what was someone so like the first time you met them so finally we get to ask what Paul Graham is like so it's in the Harvard Business School case so I initially when after I left my bank I started sort of a you know business consulting firm and I was looking for something new to do and you know came up with the internet shopping idea and one of my classmate at Harvard Business School call me Miki you need to look at this company it's called file web and it's my friend's company so I went via web calm and look at me like that next day I put a economy class airplane ticket and flew over to Boston and I visited four and it was five people company and we kind of agree that we're gonna do things together but the last minute you know poor were supposed to come over to Japan but at the airport he found out his passport is expired that's why you couldn't come and somehow the deal didn't go through so but I feel that was a really the first moment I fell I met the the truly strong entrepreneur and I felt the excitement and energy important in his team that was great thank you very much thank you
