- morning hopefully this particular works so I sat down to write this talk I really racked my brains to try to figure out what the most interesting and relevant and and useful content would be for a lot of people who are sort of interested in web startups when I thought about it in those terms the topic of my talk became fairly obvious but then but I thought about it more and the algorithm doesn't even seem to be deterministic I'm not sure anyone even knows how it works so I guess I'll actually have to talk about stripe instead two years ago Brian from Airbnb spoke at our school in 2010 and the open is talked by showing a picture of startup school in 2008 two years previously and that picture showed a snapshot of the audience I picked out one particular head he was just sitting there an anonymous had in the audience and I know this because I was at his talking 2010 and so curious later he was on stage at school and somehow tears later Here I am and I'm sure there's at least one person here who who'd be on stage in in two years time and stripe definitely isn't as far along as Airbnb but it read Rove home the point to me when I realized this that startups are very unpredictable um you know Sarge there's really hard to get your head around I remember somebody telling me not all that long ago that that Airbnb was just becoming a huge success they were making something like $10,000 a week remember thinking man that's really impressive and now I have no idea what Airbnb is actual revenue figures are today but it wouldn't it all shock me if they're making $10,000 an hour like what's even like to try to build a company where that kind of growth is possible startups are strange for a bunch more reasons you know they're usually kind of counterintuitive because if they were in counterintuitive somebody else would probably yourself ever the problem is already and on top of that syrups often don't actually want don't actually want to be all that well understood it can actually be quite helpful to be sort of underestimated and under comprehended um but I think the biggest reason that startups are hard to understand is that so few people still get to see them up close during those first couple orders of magnitude and when people do tell the stories or when the stories are told they often tend to be kind of wrong they're about sort of rocket ships and frantically holding on and trying to add more server capacity as quickly as you can to handle the next million users they're not about the late night arguments and wondering if your product could ever possibly work or trying to figure out once you've launched your product why it's not growing and the thing is even the really successful startups have this phase but that that famous summer when Facebook moved out to Palo Alto in 2004 most people didn't realize this but there were other people in the same house working in other startups like this is the most successful technology company started in the 21st century and in the same house there were people working other startup ideas as six months after launch its it really takes a while and so stripe is obviously very very different to Facebook and Airbnb and and nowhere near as sort of far along as they are but we've now gone through a small bit of growth and so I want to try to describe how it how it actually works in October of 2009 John and I were walking home from dinner in Potrero up in the city and we should have been kicking around this idea of starting an online payments company we're really kind of fascinated by the concept of internet payments and all the other companies in the space seemed like total dinosaurs and it's the web sort of spread around the world and more deeply into our lives through mobile devices it seemed kind of obvious there should be some kind of universal payments infrastructure of the Internet though it should be just really easy to transact online and John just turned to me said you know well didn't debate about it you know how do we just go build it probably won't be all that hard he actually said that it probably would be all that hard and so I said okay sure why not backtrack a little bit here John is my co-founder right stripe um he's Alta my brother and people often asked me about how this works in practice and so for the record starting a company with your brother turns out to your really good idea John is not only one of most brilliant people I know I think he got the highest-ever results in ireland's university entrance examinations but he's also someone with whom I've literally decades of experience building things here's an an earlier venture that we worked on together and so it's October 2009 we decide to work in this online payments company we decided to call it slash dev slash payments you know the API should be just as straightforward as any other node in dev FS we're kind of okay at programming and definitely not at naming things but everyone else seriously have been targeting their product it's like they told was it a finance sector product they were targeting is CFO's and at business people and we thought the internet was just moving in a completely different direction and we decided to target makers the people actually building things we thought that internet payments was a technology problem and we wanted to build a completely new stack for anybody transacting online so we work nights and weekends we were both in college at the time I was at MIT and John was up the road at Harvard and so we'd code together in the evenings between problem sets and writing papers January rolled rounds which for both of those schools you sort of have that month off but of course anybody who knows Boston knows that January in Boston is unbelievably freezing and so we decide to go somewhere else to work for the month we'd read a few blogs that claim that Buenos Aires was surprisingly a really good place to get things done it's it's pretty cheap it's really warm its friendly for some reason I don't know why there was Wi-Fi everywhere everything happens on a really late schedule like the bars are open till 5:00 a.m. nobody has dinner until midnight and nothing nothing starts before noon and it's busy a city on a program reschedule and so you read all this and we're like great we're good of one azari's and so we did and we just worked non-stop in cafes for three weeks I've still never seen a single one of like the tourist attractions in Buenos Aires or I presume they exist and and then we'd like we could all day and we'd go to dinner eleven o'clock or something and then go to bed um I can't have a size isn't enough if you want to get something done consider going to minus R Eason On January 9 we we got our first production user for left / dad flex payments I can't really say it and this is only a few weeks after we started working on it but we really wanted to get production users shaping a product as quickly as we could the user was a friend of ours a guy called Russ Boucher was working a company called trading north at the time who's also actually YC funded and funnily enough he actually became the seventh person to work at stripe but that's a separate story and here's a screenshot of what debt payments looked like at the time and this screenshot you can see that John and I are definitely programmers and app designers but okay so January 9th we now have one user and this is a great story from the early days of Amazon that I have a celebrated when they got their first fire who wasn't any of their moms and you know Ross wasn't exactly our mom but he was a good friend and so he definitely weren't out of the woods just yet so he went back to school and weakened huge work on death payments in our spare time there was this one cafe that I worked out of so much they like took pity on me and I'm still Facebook friends with a bunch of the Bruce says that's yeah like strife is a kind of unusual company we're about technology but we're also about payments and the technology side requires good reliability and you know clean API is an really nice product and sort of lots of technology things we at least hope to know something about but the payment side requires working with banks and dealing with credit card companies and just generally handling a slew of finance industry issue issues through really had no experience with a no idea how to handle we had a lot of meetings where I sort of sat somebody down and said right so payments how do they work and you know programmers often and this is unfortunate so looked down at the folks who are trying to learn to code the sort of I want to learn real to my web startup crowd but I actually bought a sympathy for them because we were that but put in finance somewhere came around when I was six months in we moved out to Palo Alto and though we hadn't actually yet decided to take a leave from school we found a tiny bungalow at just off University Ave the living room and the kitchen became our office it was pretty hot reading of any air-conditioning and so John just slept in the garden most nights and he wouldn't allow me to post a picture of this um and by and large we just kept on writing code because I mean that's mostly what starting a software company looks like in the early days you're either writing code or you're talking to people who use the code or you're probably wasting time and here's a chart of our transaction volume over the first six months and and that's not a technical error if you look really closely even see a tiny little wiggly line at the bottom it's admittedly not wiggling all that much around this time though we did of our first person join we're based in Silicon Valley home to the best international talents from Berlin to Beijing to Bangalore and so of course we took advantage of it we heard a guy called DARAB Utley who was one of my smartest friends from college and he grew up in a small town called Limerick in Ireland about two miles from her John and I grew up we altar rates our first investment I have a first real investment I guess YC had obviously already invested and and this was from from Peter teal after then we hadn't told very many people about dev payments and those we had told had reacted mostly by telling us we were crazy but of course luckily Peter teal is crazy and so he invested and it's been really helpful to have him on board soon after that moved into our first office and which looked something like this it's actually sort of it's it's a Ramona in University and Palo Alto just next sort of koopa cafe that's actually a converted house and because it was a house it had this wonderful fireplace they were able to light in the winter the fireplace looks something like this which I think may have contravenes some fire in the workplace codes and basically we're just working non-stop we we actually have we became four people around this time that the first person fourth person was a guy named Greg I remember when Greg was considering joining and dropping out of school he asked me about our work schedule and whether or not we worked weekends obviously we did work weekends but it really didn't want to make it sort of scare him off and make it seem like he'd have to answer so I sort of said well you know we usually work some of the weekend we really care about work-life balance and Greg just cut me off and he's like great I'm better on the same page I working all day every day and so we knew he'd fit in we decided to change our name I can't even begin to list the problems that flashed as slash payments had somehow it turned out that not everyone immediately got the deficit analogy nobody was really able to get their head around the whole slash thing and we started to get mail with things like this and and then there was the admittedly pretty inconvenient fact that Amazon had launched a product an online payments product called Amazon dev pay and so if Precure this wasn't going to work out and so we spent hours brainstorming names and we eventually came up with the name stripe and we didn't actually think that stripe was all that great a name when we first came up with it but we decide to just put a date in the calendar and if we didn't cover the better name by that date then we'd secret stripe and sure enough it became stripe and actually a few months later I learned that this is our Apple ended up with the name Apple it's the exact same date thing anyway reach the end of our first year mostly intact a bunch of Y Combinator companies start to use stripe and that was pretty good we're getting some real feedback and here's another chart this is our transaction volume through the first year and so you can see still kind of a ways to go we spent January 2011 or when your anniversary in Rio de Janeiro because January in South America was not becoming a tradition as anyone who's been to Rio de Janeiro knows it's one of the most beautiful places on earth and of course we took full advantage of it at this point we're still an invite-only private beta and so there probably is something obvious we could have done to grow at least a little bit faster ie to launch a friend refers to invite only private beta as the baby blanket of startups and I think that's about right but the beta period was actually really helpful to stripe um amber Paul Buchheit saying that should start out by making hundred people really happy rather than many more people only a little bit happy I mean you really took this to heart and took advantage of the the small number of users to sort of really focus on them as much as we could and so really try to figure out what they wanted it's a forgettable not long after we launched the first version of strife we added pager duty so we'd all get calls from the side was down you pretty standard and pretty reasonable but then we realized that any time a user gets any kind of error like even if the site isn't down that's actually a really bad experience for them and we could probably make them much happier if we went and investigated the error and sort of proactively reach out to them and helped him fix it and so we changed the code a little bit so that anytime anyone hit any error it would send an email that would go sort of straight the top of everybody's inbox and would also phone everybody and and we'd go and fix it no matter what and I really mean that like we would get out of bed if necessary and we're basically never without a laptop and the means to tether here's a photo of one such incident this is bragging eye we'd gone to the cinema in Redwood City a user encountered an error and so of course out came our laptops and we had to go fix it I think Greg I think Greg is here summer actually and I think he still feels a little bit bitter about missing the start of the movie over this and the movie may or may not have been Twilight Breaking Dawn start ups are high stress you need to unwind we also realized that I am in with an engineer is basically the best support experience possible like it's really frustrating to have to go in to file a ticket and more like find the support email address and then wonder does this come to actually apply to their support emails or if they do reply how long does it take them or all these issues like it's much nice we can just start sort of directly chatting with somebody and it's also way more productive for us because we can then go and sort of try to figure out what the underlying issue is rather than having to sort of guess based on the user's initial description so we just opened up this this chat system on our website where anyone can jump in and just start asking questions and we actually still have this today and that was it was really good but then we thought why stop there isn't it really a really bad experience when somebody asks a question and there's nobody there to answer them and so we thought aha pager duty and so we hooked it up so that if you asked a question in the Striped chat room and there was nobody there to answer you it would go and phone one of us after 30 seconds and so I don't think many people know this for like for many months at stripe if you asked a question in our chat room and there's no one there to answer someone will be woken up if necessary to help you we don't do that tonight and so those stripe wasn't yet publicly available to everyone we really tried to sort of turn up the dial on our users feedback and to force ourselves to be extremely sensitive to what they wanted and to what their experience was like we our users talking to us during every waking hour and if anything went wrong for them they were like literally interrupting our sleep the other thing that kept us in beta was the fact we weren't just building a thin software layer and we thought that stripe should encompass everything from the API requests to have the money ended up in your bank account and we wanted to be able to define the complete experience and we wanted to be able to do it at scale we were sort of really influenced by things like Amazon Web Services in ec2 which just it's really interesting innovation because ec2 is fantastic if you're a small company or a startup startup or a side project or something like this but its scale is right through to be a Netflix or a Zynga or indeed an Amazon it'll work for a company of any size and we decided that we wanted to do that but for internet payments infrastructure we wanted to make something that was really easy to start with but something would also work for the largest companies in the world until that meant working with really good banks but the problem is that banks and startups are basically the business equivalent of oil and water and figuring out how to combine them is pretty hard the best bank in the business is probably Wells Fargo which powers some of the largest payments companies in the world and honestly it was pretty tough to get them to talk to us or us even to like return our emails and they probably thought were some strange kind of Nigerian scam like make money online fast all from the comfort of your own home so we asked a friend and investor actually now a partner at Y Combinator Jeff Ralston to help out Jeff had previously been CEO of a company called Lala an online music startup and they had negotiated successfully with the record labels and we thought that if you could as a technology startup could say it successfully with record labels you could basically convince anyone in the world to do anything ever and here's a picture of Jeff on a conference call with Wells Fargo and that's that's Dara there on the other side and you might wonder why is Jeff from the floor well Jeff is on the floor because our office was also flooded at the time and we also had a security audit that day sometimes turrets are just like a reality TV show it's like negotiate with one of the biggest banks in the world while undergoing a security audit while waiting through water and I don't know the water is full of piranhas or something but I see Jeff and a bunch of others we eventually convinced Wells Fargo to become one of our backends this meant moving all of our systems to work on top of their platform and was a couple of weeks of honestly really intense work we had to sort of hit a particular deadline this is the night of our first successful transaction this is John after another particularly long all-nighter and in general and I kind of mean this seriously like this is the unglamorous site of startups that people do not get to see all that much like you really want to make something work and a lot of other people think that it's a bad idea and it's really hard and everything happens much much slower than you like and you've sort of many late night discussions like this and sort of soul-searching debates and wondering like this is actually a good idea or maybe it is a good idea but it's just too hard for us to pull off and syrups are hard and the thing is this doesn't actually go away this is the thing that I didn't realize before doing a startup I thought that sort of you have all these doubts in the early days then it was hard to take off and things would get easy but no matter how successful you will have lots of doubts and the first American to win the trade of France was a guy called Greg Lomond and he has this quote I've always really liked it doesn't get easier you just got to go faster and it's kind of like this foot startups like the startup might might start going faster but it doesn't really get easier in our case we eventually got the pieces in place and we got to the point for ready to launch we launched in the 29th of September 2011 so just over a year ago at that time stripe didn't predict had been in production use for 19 months and and we've been working at full time for a year and three months we're ten people when we launched I fail to fit all the names in a tree and by the end of the year here's what our daily transaction volume looked like you know kind of promising but the launching is definitely not a panacea but the signs were positive and we kept going and over the last few months like two and a half years in stripe is finally started to become an overnight success Jessica talked about how startups are our roller coasters and there's a lot of downs but there's also ups and the next slide is our daily transaction volume through to today and it looks like this from being four people not all that long ago stripe is now 34 people which is actually twice as many people as are in this picture because everything is always behind them I start off and we haven't got around to taking our new group shot yet and many thousands of companies are using stripe and a lot of new ones go live every day and I mean it's a bunch of well-known brands like Foursquare and foxy and Hipmunk and the FF and New York moment but a lot of less well-known ones too and and they actually tend to be sort of just as interesting there's things like good eggs which enables you to buy directly from local farmers or samasource which brings computer-based work to people living in poverty or even stuff like the Bedford cheese shop which is never just selling its cheese online I guess I just hungry you guys making these slides and she seemed like a good idea okay um has anyone here ever looked into the history of container shipping sorry I know this is a context switch from cheese container shipping like and the shipping container like those 40-foot shipping containers on some level they're the most mundane thing in the world and we see them around all the time but there were actually an absolutely enormous innovation sixty years ago before shipping containers transportation was a massive issue with physical goods transportation costs often accounted for up to 25 percent of the final cost of a physical item and overall transportation costs and shipping costs were like 10 percent of the value of all the imports in the US like think about that from a 10% that means if your margins 20 percent just by bringing you're good to another market you cut your profit in half and so unsurprisingly most manufacturing happens are very close to where a physical product was consumed until the shipping container invented in the mid-1950s essentially eliminated the cost of shipping physical goods it cut the cost of loading and unloading ships by 95% and it's now at the point 4 and actually quoting this from a US government report it's better to assume that moving goods is essentially costless really and the history here is fascinating there's a few kind of good books about it but the point is like this technological breakthrough and sort of this of friction and a particular this abstraction of our geography it played an enormous role in in facilitating the rise of Singapore and South Korea and Taiwan and Japan and China as manufacturing hubs and we pointed really that a technology that doesn't just monetize itself but actually enables newcomers can really enormous impact like the shipping container literally reshaped the world's economy we sometimes subscribe we're doing with stripe as building economic infrastructure for the Internet it's not very flashy but for most of human history we've had to buy from the people beside us but and thanks to the internet that's no longer true we have a new way to abstract over place anyone can now build a global business but yeah while the Internet has revolutionized how we communicate and how we collaborate and how we share we've only sort of started to explore how that can change what we create and how we transact and what kind of business is possible and a lot of the other companies whose founders are speaking today are pretty good examples of that it's with stripe we simply want to turn payments into a ubiquitous utility we want more commerce on the Internet but it's still really early days and honestly most of the time we're not thinking about these kinds of problems we're trying figure I had to decrease the load on DB 3 or trying to get some particular design you know just right and working for the 20th iteration we're wondering if some particular product is a good idea or having some debate you know in Gmail that's so long we've overflowed the Gmail thread limit and it's now become something completely new thread or like it's all the the day-to-day stuff but you know it turns out that all the high-level stuff the the larger motivations and the bigger ideas and the day-to-day implementation like the debates and the tweaking and the and the iterations both of them are really addictive and that's why we keep doing this thank you
