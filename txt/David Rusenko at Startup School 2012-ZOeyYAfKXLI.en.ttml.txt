- well thanks for having me guys you hear me alright cool so I wanted to start by just going over the Weebly story a little bit telling you kind of how we got to where we got to today and some of the lessons we learned along the way so what is Weebly first of all is if some of you guys haven't heard of it Weebly is a simple and powerful way to create a site people want to create a site they want to create a blog they want to sell things online and they just want to work they don't want any of the frustrations around it so let me show you a couple Weebly sites the first site is a photographer from Toronto showcasing their photography the second site is an interior designer from Oregon these they've actually been featured in dwell magazine for their interior designs run their website on Weebly the third side is a graphic designer from California can see all these sites just look great and not one line of HTML or CSS was written for these sites this next site is pretty special this is Brian he's 80 years old he retired and his passion is building ukuleles and he started doing his spare time went on Weebly and created a website what do you know the word got out and you know he could build a couple ukuleles out of a shop per month he now has a three to six month back order of ukuleles and this last site is really special to us you may have seen that along with not initiative I think last year but but this group of students who had volunteered in Kenya heard this story about Omari that had been brutally attacked while trying to fend his orphanage and they didn't even have a fence to defend themselves so they created a Weebly website about this posted it to Reddit and were able to raise over $100,000 in less than a week for the orphanage and they built a they built a wall and a fence and much more than that and that's actually now helping out that orphanage in Kenya so a little bit about our story and how we got to where we are today in early 2006 as part of a class project at Penn State we were came up with the same idea six years ago we thought you know why is this so hard why is it still so hard to build a website we're seeing people all around us that we're just struggling and so we came up with the idea we start working on now I'm gonna introduce you to the theme in the presentation here this is a graph of our new signups per day now this is August 2006 this is real data and you can see up at the top it's six months after we started working on Weebly so six months six months after we wrote our first line of code our grand sign of day we got 12 new users and you know it's just kind of friends and family it was so alpha stage this wasn't something that was easy to pump out a month is something that was difficult that took some time to build so over that summer dan and I and Chris were working on it here's October 2006 eight months later so we've now been writing code and working on the idea for eight months we posted a private beta invitation on some forums and we thought man this is gonna blow up and we got about 30 people signed up that day so you know around this time I was up pretty late at night was browsing / thought that kind of tells you also you know that was the most popular tech news site back then and I was reading an article on Y Combinator I said you know I think I've heard about this coming before I'm not really sure started reading the article oh this sounds really cool it sounds interesting Oh application deadlines in two hours so well I thought you know what the hell I'll put something together really quick you know it doesn't hurt to apply now I didn't actually have enough time to call a Dan or Chris to ask them if they'd be willing to drop out of school moved to San Francisco so I took a guess I figured you know Chris would probably do it he's a little he's a pretty wild guy and Dan's a pretty wild guy too but but I figured he might want to finish his college career so you know we we applied to YC with literally less than an hour to go on the clock got accepted for an interview drove up to Boston interviewed we thought we thought it was great incidentally the morning of the interview I wake up check my phone I'm ringing email bleary-eyed and and I got an email from someone Congrats on the tech crunching what the hell is this about so open TechCrunch is just so happened that TechCrunch operated by us that morning the you know I'm sure it definitely didn't hurt with the interview but I also had to explain this graph this is really important this is not normally what a tech crunching looks like normally it goes straight up and straight back down we had an invitation system in place you know make sure our servers didn't crash and so that's why I see it spread out over more time but you know later that night though you know Paul told us expect a call from us by 7:00 p.m. the same day we'll let you know if he made it or not so you know we were pretty nervous and we went out to dinner and we sat down and literally I remember you know 7:00 p.m. rolled around and 8:00 p.m. rolled around and we were all just staring at our plates of food in front of us like we literally couldn't eat we were so nervous and then by 9:00 p.m. we're like this is it we're definitely not making it in they've called everyone they've accepted and now they're just calling the losers that aren't getting in so I think around 9:00 9:30 the phone call from Paul comes and I answer and literally his first words were I'm calling to end your college career so you know funnily enough you know I ended up talking to Dan later and say hey guys you wanna do you wanna you know I know we have a semester left but it sounds crazy but how about we just drop out of school moved to San Francisco what do you think of it and Chris was like hell yeah let's do it and and as Dan I'm like Dan like what do you think this is pretty crazy he's like yeah I'm on board that sounds awesome so you know this is this is a picture of us that we took right after we got that phone call I think this picture was also right after we each took three shots at the bar to celebrate and this is with our friend Dana so the next graph is January 2007 so we move out to San Francisco start the Y Combinator program it's now 11 months after we started working on Weebly you know this is a pretty long time this is almost a full year after you started writing our first line of code I want you to take a look at this graph and I want you to notice something this isn't straight up into the right it goes straight up it comes straight back down now maybe you got a couple squiggles here that a little that are a little hopeful but things aren't looking great we're getting less than a hundred people per day signing up right now almost a year after we started working on Weebly you know this is a picture of our first office so we literally moved into an apartment we put three desks together you could really tell how long ago this was because that old-ass TV in the lower right-hand corner and then and the 15-inch monitors and we literally just pushed three desks together put it in the living room and this is this is what startup looks like we just worked our asses off we had one important rule which is we took Saturday off but otherwise every other moment every other waking moment was 24/7 work wasn't all bad we had a great view of the San Francisco Bay and you know this is this is a fun story this is a little display that Chris hacked up and he just put it in the middle of the table and it showed kind of some basic stats so it showed like load average which you don't see right here but it also showed total users and logged in users and there's three logging users here that's because it was a three of us around the table using Weebly and one of the one of our biggest moments still I think in company history was one night we were sitting there and it went for you know and like we were excited that was exciting so you know in January 2007 we also got featured on TechCrunch again this is much more normal it goes straight up and straight back down and you know again 11 months after we started working on Weebly this is April 2007 and there's a couple hard times I also want to share cuz sometimes you just hear about the good stuff you don't hear about the bad stuff you don't hear about the times were really hard this is 14 months after you start working on Whaley now the first thing I want to address on this slide is the signup graph I kind of want you to look at the end there and notice you know I think we were just oblivious and very hopeful the time but that kind of looks like it's heading down it's not heading up it's actually heading in the wrong direction at this point in April 2007 I mean we were just finishing the YC program we were really hopeful that we could raise money but you know talking to some angel investors but at one point we had less than 100 bucks in our bank account and that's all the money we had we you know we spent money on two things early on we spent money on rent and we spent money at the bar and and and that's pretty much it and you know we were pretty hopeful but rent was coming up in two weeks and we had to pay rent in two weeks so we started talking about raising a friends and family around we started talking about moving to San Jose to save 800 bucks a month and rent and luckily we didn't do that yeah and you know luckily sort of right in the nick of time we end up raising 650k angel round from from Ron from Steve Anderson Mike maples a bunch of angels this is another thing that really dates this story that big stack of paperwork is when equity financing looks like these days you know all the financing most really stage finances are done via convertible note to three pages tops this is a fat stack for an equity financing so you know the next big thing for us was being featured in Newsweek now this used to be of a really big deal I don't know today if it's as much of a big deal but back then this was a huge deal this was the thing that your parents like bought 10 copies the magazine afford it to everyone they knew and so this was a really big deal 15 months in that that was definitely a high point and that's what that looks like so now you're seeing the effect of what being featured in Newsweek looks like you know again it's a very similar pattern it goes up and it comes right back down you're now noticing you know it settles higher that's definitely a good sign but it's still going down it's not going up this is 15 months after we started working on Weebly you know here's a shot of our office here in in July 2007 and it's that's Dan sitting there and that's also our stats dashboard that you could kind of see what's going on next big moment for us around the same time was being featured in time so we're featuring time is one of the 50 best websites of 2007 this is 18 months after you start working on Weebly a year and a half after we started working on Weebly and things still aren't taking off there's no hockey stick here things are actually going in the wrong direction now I want to try something out here raise your hand if you're currently working on a startup okay now keep hand up nope nope cute keep your hands up now keep your hand up only if you've been working on for over 18 months okay right that's what I thought it's a long time this is a really long time and we didn't have any we didn't have too much positive we were just sort of naive we were naively hopeful that things were working out and we knew it was a good problem to be solving we're getting feedback from our users but you know the metrics weren't entirely there yet and this is where it changes this is this is 20 months and finally finally 20 months after we start working on we were seeing our first real traction now this is good this is where your your rate of acquiring news per day is increasing linearly that's a pretty good thing and one thing to notice you know you you might think hey if only I get on TechCrunch I'll blow up you know my company will be successful if I just get on TechCrunch well look all the way back there just via word-of-mouth now we are now getting more users every single day than if we were featured in newsweek time or TechCrunch in july 2008 we moved in our first rail office 29 months after you start working on we leave funny story that TV on the wall got stolen our office got broken into the first week we moved in that was fun getting a call from the police officer at the next day bein like you gotta come deal with your office is busted so you know here's another picture and this is this was just it was small it was 1400 square feet we ended up fitting I think about 12 people there and and you know around the summer time we started looking at our bank account balance and and you know we're like okay well you know how much runway do we have this is an important thing to know if you're not profitable how much runway do we have we said okay well well we really need to start raising money in September you know maybe October in November we're gonna run out of money it's you know so so we said well what the hell let's let's give it a shot at least start making some money so July 2008 when we choose Weebly Pro we also sell domain names now and when we start at that time and you know things were looking good but if you know anything about the fall of 2008 it was just a really bad time to be raising money so we went out there and you know might have worked but the terms were just not what we are looking for so this is a graph of our company bank account balance I actually hacked up Vanguard's graphic you know like flash graph to plot an XML feed to graph this for you guys this is 34 months after we started working on Weebly and it was pretty low and and and this is you know this is this is another hard time we basically we we looked at our bank account balance and we said okay well you know revenue is increasing and things are going in the right direction then we're pretty hopeful we could squeeze through but you know but we can't pay our bills next month so we're we gonna do about it so you know obviously payroll was just never an option we're obviously gonna pay payroll if we had to cut our own salaries that was gonna be one thing but for people with employed that was just not an option not to pay that so the next step was to get out of calendar literally I remember getting out a big calendar on a piece of paper and mapping out all our bills on which days they were due and how much money we thought we were gonna make in the meantime to just barely squeaked by and and then there was really two types of bills that we labeled there was one there was a type of bill that if you didn't pay it you got a late fee and the second type of bill if you didn't pay it they shot your servers off so obviously we had to pay that second category but you know in January 2009 which is which is a great month for us you know we finally hit break-even now this is where things started turning in the in the profitable direction and you know this is where you first start seeing a working business model it finally clicks and you can see a little bit of history out there 35 months that's three years after we started working on it we finally hit a working business model this is February 2010 and now things are looking great now we're off to the races this is four years after we started working on Weebly and I want you to notice all the way in the back that that Newsweek that time you know the TechCrunch articles they're just blips on the radar you know now every day we're getting about 5,000 new users per day all of the award math it's all organic growth in March 2011 sixty-one months after we started we partnered with Sequoia Capital we love them as partners and brought them on board to help grow the business and that brings us to today so where are we now today we bleep our is about 2% of the active web sites on the internet that's all based on public data from net craft every month 15% of the United States visits a Weebly website and my favorite stat here is our Net Promoter Score our Net Promoter Score is over 80% now if you're not familiar with what a net promoter score is that's you know that means 88% of people who answered this survey said 9 or 10 likely they're gonna recommend we do a friend as a point of comparison I think apples is 67% that's considered excellent this explains everything about our business a quick tour of the office here moved in this office about a year ago this is what it looks like when you walk in this is this a quick snapshot of our lobby and conference room at the front here's our open work plan area and you know we really like this because you could really talk and communicate but obviously it gets noisy so one of the things that we give everyone who works at Weebly as bose noise-canceling headphones to block out the noise it's a TV room great for catching a big game especially the Giants games have been on lately and this is this is our kind of you know kitchen slash rec area downstairs we get super competitive on ping-pong pool foosball one thing I want you to notice is that bookshelf in the back actually if you go up to that and you know the right book to pull it actually opens up I'm not sure how well you can see that but it's it's its policy we can't show anyone pictures of inside the secret room unless you come visit so we'd love to have you over to check that out so you know just for shits and giggles I pulled our bank account balance from this morning that's what our company thank you balance looks like now and this is 80 months after we started working on Weebly I think the important message here is it's still an unfinished story you know I mean as large as we've been able to grow this is just the beginning so you know what's next for Weebly well six years ago we thought the same thing you know making a site it's just hard you know and today people are just as frustrated you know just as confused and all they really want to do is participate in the Internet and you know what most people can't participate in the internet the way they'd like to you know people just want to you know showcase their business showcase their art or their talents and sell things online and it's still too difficult for them so you know as much as we've done the last six years we think we've just built a foundation and what's most exciting is is what we're building it right now and there's just a whole lot of work left to do so I think the number one takeaway of everything is you can't succeed if you quit too often I've seen people that build something for six months and then they launch it and then two months later they stop working on it like how do you expect that to work you know behind every I think we've seen today behind every quote-unquote overnight success you see people who have been working for years and years and years and if you want to build a truly big and meaningful company it's gonna take you seven to ten years of your life you know don't give up so easily you just gotta keep going even at the early days for everyone including us it didn't look great you just have to push through and know that you're working on a valuable problem and keep pushing through so lastly I'll close with it you know if you'd like to help us finish the story that that's still in progress we'd love to talk to you but I won't go into much about that if you have any other questions please email me hope to see you at the party tonight and thank you very much
